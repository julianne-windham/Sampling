Complainant:  Jean (or June?) Frederick
Respondent: Water Haulers
Summary:  June (or Jean) Fredrick from Rancho Tehema (I believe west of I5 between Red Bluff and Corning) complaining about numerous water trucks criss-crossing the town daily to supposedly provide water to the pot farms in the area.  

Tom P. contacted June Fredrick on June 26, 2014 to obtain additional details.  Ms. Fredrick did not have any specific information about where the water was being extracted or where it was being used, but she felt that it should be looked into.  She also complained that someone had planted an olive orchard between Rancho Tehama and I-5, which is irrigated with wells. I explained that irrigating olive trees was no an unlawful use of water.  I also obtained contact information for the Rancho Tehama Association.  During a subsequent phone conversation with Ms. Carrie Lee, of the Association, it was determined that the Association is taking action to identify the parties who are allowing trucks to fill from their privater wells.  This is a violation of County Ordinance No. 1617, and the Association is working with the County Department of Environmental Health, which is the local agency that enforces this ordinance.  No further action on this complaint by Division staff is necessary.  A contact report for the phone conversation with the representative of the Association is attached."

far. Dozens of illegal marijuana grows have been popping up all over unincorporated areas of this region. From my

pipes leading from the ditch to their grow operations); however, NYWD general manager and staff (who are
responsible for maintaining this ditch) are clearly ignoring the taking of water. Some growers simply throw a pump in
the ditch when needed. If a person walks the ditch - you can clearly see the grow operations. These grow sites go
back at least a decade or more in some cases- we have included aerial historical imagery to demonstrate this in our
exhibits. Water is being stolen from irrigation customers every year with NYWD turning a blind eye to the situation. I
am sending a link to the files showing the APNs of these illegal grows as well photographs of the illegal grows
through time. It is clear that these grows have been in place for many years and that illegal taking of water from the
FT Ditch has also been going for years. Some of these parcels and grows are owned by Laotian cartel members who
were busted in Elk Grove back in 2013. You can verify this by looking at the names of the owners. (e.g., Qiong Mao

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Dear Gentlepersons,

My neighbor has constructed 5 dams across a seasonal streambed, not diversions, actually dug basins and dammed the streambed. His name is John Voerman, 28130 Teresa Springs Rd, Tollhouse. Ca 93667.

He constructed the first dam using a bobcat in 2018, and the remaining 4, just this past year. The first earthen dam is 25 feet across, 12 feet wide, and five feet high. He drives his truck across it.

 I have lived here for over forty years and have relied on that streambed to recharge my well. So do other families downstream from me. We no longer get any runoff at all, except in torrential storms. I keep track of rainfall every year. In years of little rainfall, I have seen much water in this stream. We average 22 inches of rain here. The stream used to run into early summer. Now it halts right after any rainfall. This is the streambed this area is named after and has been a free flowing stream since forever.

Three years ago, this neighbor bought this property, and constructed the first dam below the origins of this stream. I told him he should be diverting water adjacent to the streambed but not in it, only at high water times and even then only a small pipe. I informed him if he blocked the entire streambed, this would cause problems for me and people downstream because of silt and no recharging of wells.

He has no way to control the stream at flood stage. Silt from his first dam filled my part of the streambed and diverted water around my well head. I had to quickly construct a barrier and clear the streambed before my well could be inundated and compromised. This has never happened in over forty years! Silt has always been flushed with even the smallest of downpours in the past, but not the last three years. I have corroborated this with other neighbors downstream.  I told my neighbor, he should remove his dam. His action? He built four more dams! I know that if I see this much silt on the surface, it is filling my well, my neighbors downstream, and his too? Please help.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Our names are Barb and Fred Daskoski. We live at 13090 Shenandoah Rd. Plymouth, Amador County. We own 80 acres of wildland, and raise cattle. Big Indian Creek crosses our property, which we have several open pit mines coming up from the creek. These mines were made by the 49ers, back in the 1800?s. The property to the north of our fence line has a surface water collection ditch that runs along our property line, and another property to the east of us. All of this collected water is directed to their pond, to the west. Our frontage with this property is about 1200 feet but only 700 feet is adjacent to their surface water collection ditch. Their surface water collection ditch, on our neighbors property is roughly 2000 feet. That puts about 1300 feet of this surface collection ditch on another property. In the winter of 2017, their surface water collection ditch was providing so much water that their dam was overflowing. They were extremely concerned of their dam failing. To relieve stress on their dam, the neighbors decided to divert all of this water that they had collected, in their water collection ditch, onto our property. This water being dumped onto our property without our knowledge. This water washed all of our burn piles down the miners open area, washing down ash (from our burn piles), tree limbs, brush, dirt, and cow manure, wild animal and rodent feces into Big Indian Creek. This water in Big Indian Creek all flows into the Cosumnes River, which ends up as our drinking water. We have told the owners that this was all unwanted water, and this action was to stop immediately. Of course, this action went on several days, until we threatened them with court action. We asked the neighbors to come up with a solution, for the future. One of the owners said that they would take 4 feet off the dam, and seal the back side of the dam. Again, we told our neighbors we did not want this unwanted water on our property. To this date, our neighbors have not done anything to relieve this problem, almost breaching the dam again, this last winter. They have not come up with a plan, other than to keep dumping unwanted water onto our property. We found out, that the reason that they dumped their water, was to keep pressure off their dam. The owners of the pond did a dam integrity report. We believe that it was not favorable, for the owners of the dam said that it would cost around 70,000 dollars to fix it. The neighbors believe that the dam could fail, thus routing their water off their property. The dam leaks 24/7, 365 days of the year. From what we can tell, the owners did not file a water diversion plan with the state in 2017, hiding the diversion of the water they did. We believe that the state can fine the property owners 1000 dollars for not filing a water diversion statement, plus 500 dollars per day that the violation continues. We have owned our property for 30 years, and have never heard of any water being dumped onto our property. Nor have we been informed of any dumping of water by any of our neighbors, and we have never given any permission to do so. We have been trying to find the correct state agency to contact for the last 2 years. We keep getting ignored, passed off to someone that drops the ball, never getting a return call, telling us that we have the wrong agency, whatever. Until now, we were told to file a complaint with you.

It is unclear where exactly he is sending the water. They list some parcel info on the paperwork. Not sure it's accurate though based on the other erroneous info listed.
I'm available at 805-280-2186

I wanted to bring something to your attention that needs addressing.
There is a large diversion on 12 Mile Creek South Fork which is in California. It is an appropriated water right that lies on USFS property. The diversion is Run by Nathan & Mattie Bunting DBA  Lazy Spade LLC. We have noticed large fluctuations in the water flowing down the creek across our property. I have not been to the diversion as it's accessed through the neighbor who operates the diversions property. I have attached the only documentation I was able to locate through the state database.
The diversion is unmetered.
Some items to note that appear to be inaccurate.
He says the diversion  is from 12 Mile creek. When you look at the map he attached and locate the point of diversion using the coordinates listed it falls on the headwaters of 10 mile creek not 12 Mile South Fork.
The main diversion I believe is on the S. Fork of 12 Mile creek (not shown on his Map) and captures the flow of 10 Mile creek as the ditch passes over the 10 Mile creek drainage.
He completely dewaters 10 Mile creek. I suspect the North Fork of 12 Mile in Oregon is what is contributing most of the flow across our property as it is undiverted. I was up the South Fork of 12 Mile  above the confluence in Late July and it had a decent flow below the diversion but I suspect a lot of that comes from springs below the diversion and the leaking diversion ditch. There are trout in both forks of 12 Mile  below the diversion but none in 10 Mile as it is dry except for a few springs on the lower reaches. 
Also to note on the permit the diversions erroneously  claims to be pulling water from a tributary of the Pit River. This is entirely incorrect as 12 Mile and all its Tributary flow to the Warner lakes in Oregon.
The current diversion takes its water to Surprise Valley in California. 
I understand the  diverter  has a project underway to place the water in a large pipe rather than the ditch which has historically leaked. Once flow is in the pipe no water will leak to recharge the 12 mile drainage. I do not know how he is allowed to do this project on public land as it is an entirely different use than the original appropriated water right he claims to be acting upon. From what I understand he has no permit to conduct this upgrade to the diversion. I have spoken with the Adel irrigation district in Oregon, the ultimate end user of the 12 Mi",Modoc,To be determined,,,,3,,yes,no,Brian  Coats,3/1/2023 12:00:00 AM,Peter Lapidus,N,Complainant,"PO Box 1262, Carpinteria, California, 93014",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Nathan & Mattie Bunting,,Respondent,"PO Box 1035, Red Bluff, California, 96080",547248,S022081,,,1,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

The normal water flow in South Wolf Creek has virtually stopped. This is not normal and I believe water is being diverted upstream as well as possibly stolen from the waterway. I have contacted Nevada Irrigation District (NID) as well as the Dept of Fish and Wildlife. I live on this waterway and have for 19 years. In the past when water flow is reduced or halted, it has always been because of theft. This creek is considered year round. Many wildlife depend on this water. We have a beaver, native turtles, trout and other fish, crawdads, many birds and ducks, including wood ducks, a blue heron, kingfishers, etc. It is very important that the flow of water gets resumed.: 09746",Nevada,South Wolf Creek,,39.068611,-121.073889,1,,no,no,eWRIMS,6/5/2023 2:01:01 PM,Debbie Porter,,Complainant,"10701 Sharmiden Way, Grass Valley, CA",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,8560,Complaint,7/26/2016,2/25/2022,Kathy Bare,Water Rights - Enforcement,,Low,"Division staff's investigation concluded that there was no natural flow in South Wolf Creek at the time the complaints were received.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Water diversion took place in August of 2017 from our pond by a neighbor who is claiming water/ miners rights because of a mine that sits on his property. The diversion was then done by another neighbor who chose to get involved by stating; he was helping out a neighbor who was claiming the water rights. We have made several attempts to appeal the diversion, but have had no progress. The pond sits in the middle of our 4 acre parcel and has been an established water source as far back as our county assessor records state, but the pond itself seems to be much older. Our area has a history of gold mining, our pond and surrounding water flow indicate such past activity. Our neighbor who has decided to claim the water by diversion, had no history of any pipes for water flow going towards his property, reversing the established water flow that came towards our pond. This will put our pond at risk of a loss of water source during the summer months and has many direct consequences to our water shed area, as well as the impact on environment and natural elements that exist with the pond. In addition to the water concerns, we have only one access to our home and this is a driveway that crosses over the pond (moat style). We have concerns of rodent/gopher damage that would devastate our only entrance.

CDPH Private Water Source Operator (PWSO) license No. 86007 & 86060 with license dates of 05/12/88 & 01/26/94, respectively, are of record. The respective licensees are Baxter Enterprises with a spring inspection date of 1/89 & Baxter Ranch Holding Co., Inc. with a spring inspection dates of 11/29/93. The CDPH, Dept. of Food & Drug, Water Desk, PWSO license files indicate on the date of inspection surface water was flowing from springs pertaining to the aforementioned licenses of record. These files should be examined in conjunction with files pertaining to Water Right ID No. A009814, A029478, S012331, & S013329. Those files should enable a reasonable determination of the amount of surface water issuing from the springs on the dates they were inspected. Observing current condition of the Responsible Party's property shall demonstrate the flow of surface water from those springs has been reduced and effected by the Responsible Party's pump located on his property. The water discharged by that pump is diverted and sold by the Responsible Party and used off site by others. The Responsible Party is diverting and using surface water without a basis of right, in violation of the CA Water Code. As a result, the CA Water Code requires that a Cease and Desist Order shall be issued.

Kenny Creek located in Branscomb Ca. which is in Mendocino County had a good year for rain. The creek was running extremely well and now the first of June the water table has dropped considerably and I have concerns that the water is being diverted illegally and used for large pot grows. I do not believe that the proper permits are in place for the water draws and would like this investigated as there was a complete shut down of Kenny Creek last year 2015. That was on BLM I believe but there are still a lot of private property that has access to Kenny Creek.

Kenny Creek in Branscomb, Ca. 95417 is part of the South Fork of the Eel River. Kenny Creek comes down and intersects with the Eel at Branscomb Road at the 12 mile marker just west of the Branscomb store in Branscomb, Ca. Kenny creek has been over the last few years become a huge pot growing system that has people pulling water from Kenny creek for the very large grows. I have checked with the State Water Board and there does not seem to be any permits that have been filed for water diversion or storage up Kenny Creek. The diversions are happening approximately 1 mile up or North on Kenny Creek from Branscomb and continuing out Kenny Creek. There is at least one large green house grow and many out door grows that are visible from satellite maps. The water is being taken out of Kenny Creek up stream and the rate of water flow in August has dramatically declined as the grows become mature and larger. Last year in 2015 there was a huge dam built at the headwaters of Kenny Creek that literally stopped Kenny Creek from flowing and dried it up until the Law enforcement and Fish and Wildlife busted the grow and released the water to come down stream. This happened in late July 2015. This year we are faced again with what appears to be massive abuse of water rights and growers are pulling all the water possible for their grows with no regard for the health of Kenny Creek or the sustainability of Kenny Creek and its contribution to the South Fork of the Eel. It is a major problem as being a land owner that has filed a small domestic use and stays currant with the Water Board it cannot be stressed enough that major abuse is happening here in Branscomb.",Mendocino,Unnamed stream,South Fork Eel River,39.672222,-123.625278,1,,no,no,Kathy Bare,12/6/2018 12:00:00 AM,,Y,Complainant,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Respondent,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

I am the owner of a CA water right S021139 located in Siskiyou County. I own a diversion point and conveyance system that supplies water to my operation from a 1908 water right. I maintain my conveyance structure at my sole expense from its origination on Spring Creek to its eventual drainage back into said creek. My conveyance crosses many other properties, and three owners of separate properties along this conveyance claim a water right. Two of these properties border Spring Creek, thus no inherent access issues are present. I have been unable to validate the legitimacy of two of these claims in regards to actual existence, amount allowed or seniority. One of these property owners takes a substantial amount of water during the growing season from our ditch (as opposed to the bordering creek) and has caused substantial detriment to our right as prescribed. I have done substantial research on the eWRIMS website, as well as decree reviews and have not been able to conclusively determine a few facts relating to our local water rights situation. I would like a determination from your office on the following: 1. A comprehensive listing of all rights (CA allowed and decreed) holders within a half mile radius of ours, located at 508 North Old Stage Road, Mt. Shasta, CA 96067, including factual existence, amount prescribed (acre feet) and status in regards to Junior/Senior standing both in relation to our right and the State of California. 2. An affirmation of the fact that any property with appropriate water rights that border the source of surface water (Spring Creek) are not inherently allowed to use our diversion point and conveyance system, even though our ditch crosses private property. 3. An affirmation of the fact that the Lombardi right, being a senior right, takes de facto precedence over other currently cla",Siskiyou,Spring Creek,,41.3446,-122.3572,2,,yes,no,Mohammad  Sohrabi,5/11/2020 12:00:00 AM,Joe Corp,N,Complainant,"508 North Old Stage Road, Mount Shasta, California, 96067",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Respondent,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

DESCRIPTION: Diversion of water without a Permit. There is a well within 50 feet of San Vicente Creek (SVC) at the conveyor belt. The well is owned and operated by Trust for Public Lands (TPL). The surrounding lands are owned by Bureau of Land Management (BLM). According to the SVC Watershed Plan (2014), and BLM's own field observations, ""...the well is connected to a 6­inch pipeline that runs about 0.3 miles downstream to the location of a temporary stream gage operated by Balance Hydrology and then [east] about 0.5 miles up a hill to a pond on the ridge. Depending on the depth(s) at which the well is screened, typical pumping rates and durations, etc., it is possible that well operation results in transitory impacts to surface flows along SVC."" Balance Hydrology states that they were not able to obtain well construction and pumping records from TPL (nor Santa Cruz Co.), and therefore they could not evaluate this possibility.

Initial review suggested that water was being diverted to underground storage at a new recharge basin on nearby tribal property.

Kossack cites two appellate court cases regarding pre-14 claims and submits argument for his legal theory, but Enforcement attorneys rejected his interpretations.
Kossack also argues that the Division had evidence available to it in the original complaint investigation, by which to determine the extent of the pre-1914 claim. In this latest complaint, Kossack demands that the Division determine the extent of the pre-1914 claim or find that the diversion is without a valid basis of right. Division staff reviewed the document that Kossack refers to and found that the document merely presents flow measurements of the water supply in August and September of 1907 and an estimate made at that time of the probable maximum amount of water required by [a completed] plant. By itself, the information presented does not support a determination of the scope or the extent of the claimed right.  
While the recent complaint filed by Kossack did not include allegations of harm to public trust resources in his original submittal, Kossack subsequently referred staff to a December 2010 report by the State Water Board that listed San Vicente Creek among various streams that were identified as a high priority for conducting instream flow studies (Instream Flow Studies for the Protection of Public Trust Resources: A Prioritized Schedule and Estimate of Costs). Division staff interpreted this reference as a renewal of Kossack's previous allegation of harm on San Vicente Creek (see COMP-44400, 2015). Staff finds that this document provides no new information that would change the findings made in the case of COMP-44400."

Lastly the farm has built a pond and held back water to which they have for a couple years turned into a swimming pond. The pond is lined and the tributary stream filling the pond also overflows into the Trout Creek stream which feeds the Salinas River. This entire stream intrusion was done without permission of the army corp of engineers nor with any fish and game permits. The pond is not visible from the access road to the farm and thus not encountered by the county employees working on the cannabis permit.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: There is a water diversion ?at the Conveyor belt? on San Vicente Creek (SVC), Santa Cruz County (Lat: 37 1 17.9692, Long: -122 11 11.4350). The diversion is owned and operated by the Trust for Public Lands (TPL), formally Coast Dairies and Land (CDL). The surrounding lands are presently owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). While the diversion point is referred to as a ?well? in various descriptions of the pump and its plumbing there is no reason to believe that the diversion is actually a ?well?, that a ?well? was ever constructed at the site or that the underlying Santa Cruz Mudstone is capable of providing ?groundwater.? Use of this diversion point was abandoned in the late 1990?s subsequent to CA Department of Fish and Game?s discussions with CDL?s lessees. TPL acquired CDL in 1998. In 2004 representative(s) of CDL/TPL applied for and were issued an ?over the counter? Building Permit to rewire the pump. TPL has been diverting water without a permit from this location on an ongoing basis since that time. When TPL transferred most of their CDL lands to BLM on April 14, 2014 they retained their diversion points on Liddell Creeks and San Vicente Creek. The TPL?s diversion at the conveyor belt pumps surface water directly from San Vicente Creek. According to the SVC Watershed Plan (2014) and BLM?s own field observations, ?...the ?well? [pump] is connected to a 6-inch pipeline that runs about 0.3 miles downstream to the location of a temporary [no longer present] stream gage operated by Balance Hydrology and then [east] about 0.5 miles up a hill to a pond on the ridge? ? The diverted water is pumped out of the watershed, it is non-riparian use. California Water Boards? Instream Flow Studies for the Protection of Public Trust Resources (December 2010) identifies San Vicente Creek, Santa Cruz County, as a ?Schedule B, Priority 1 Public Trust Resource: habitat for both Coho Salmon and Winter California Steelhead.? It is our understanding that TPL?s diversion is unscreened. This diversion without a permit is current and ongoing.",Santa Cruz,To be determined,,36.9758,-122.0326,2,,yes,no,Laura  Lavallee,4/11/2019 12:00:00 AM,David S. Kossack D.,N,Complainant,"P. O.

In that complaint, Kossack suggested that water diverted from the well should subject to the permitting authority of the Board and wanted us to make a subterranean stream finding. We declined as there is no well log for the site and the geologic maps do not support such a finding.  In the new complaint, Kossack now claims that the diverter pumps surface water directly from the creek without a valid basis of right and that there is no reason to believe that the diversion is actually a well (even though the several documents that Kossack submitted in support of his earlier complaint all refer to the diversion as a well). It appears that Kossack has changed the description of his complaint in an attempt to get the State Water Board to take up his cause to restrict diversions from and water use within the San Vicente Creek watershed. However, he has provided no new evidence to support his new (modified) allegations."

Bartos provided a copy of the investigation report by the RWQCB for a recent complaint.

In general, the complaints have been unsubstantiated but continue to evolve. After a number of interactions with Mr. Defouri over the past 3.5 years, I have found him to be less than trustworthy.""
Huggins explained that, during the inspection, he did observe a small amount of water being diverted from the mine adit for use at the caretaker's cabin; however, since the flow of mine drainage water is somewhat similar to a spring that doesn¿t flow off the property, he looked at it as being similar to the §1501(a) exception under California Statutory Water Rights Law.

CalEPA is probably not the right place to find out how we can get this lawsuit thrown out, but, since Chevron wants to contaminate Monterey County water if it is allowed to do fracking that is 'irreversible.

> 
> In summary, an unpermitted earthen dam (approx. 14-acre-feet) was constructed in 2009. The County issued a violation letter but then subsequently permitted the spillway. Both DFG and RWQCB were notified but did not pursue. The watershed supports steelhead and CRLF, but the dam is a complete barrier. We were notified recently of construction on the spillway which was failing due to heavy rains. DSOD was notified and has determined that the dam is outside of their jurisdiction.
> 
> We would like to see the dam completely removed and the stream restored but our regulatory authority to require complete dam removal is limited. The landowner is an HOA and the violator is a house owner in the subdivision. The landowner/violator want to continue to use the impoundment to recharge a nearby well and irrigate the nearby residential landscaping. The recharge capacity has not been verified.
> 
> We?d like to work with the violator towards dam removal. I assume either complete or partial removal or retrofit to allow fish passage and CRLF habitat would require federal permits.

To my knowledge, the city has not obtained an appropriative water rights permit, and has no planned beneficial use for the water it would divert.  The construction project for the diversion did not go through required CEQA public review.  The only environmental document is an amendment to a previous MND for other projects which did not have impacts on downstream waters of the United States, and therefore the relevant issues (impact on riparian habitat and riparian water rights, etc.) were not addressed in the MND.  No notice or opportunity for property owners affected by this project to comment or object was ever provided.  I believe the proposed diversion is illegal, and would like the city of San Diego to be directed not to divert any water from the stream prior to proper public environmental review and obtaining a permit.

Mr. Korevaar contends that the diversion of water by the City for this project requires a post-1914 appropriative water right, that the City has no planned beneficial use for the water diverted, and that the project did not go through the required public review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to address habitat and water rights impacts downstream.

Dismissal summary:  City of San Diego is capturing natural and abandoned urban runoff in order to prevent ocean water pollution during dry periods (less than 0.1 inch precipitation).  Some of captured water are conveyed through natural channel through Complainant's property.  The captured water is diverted to sewer system for WWTP treatment.  Since there is no use of the captured water, the City cannot obtain a water right permit for diversion of such water .  The City should filed a Statement for the diversion; however, this matter is a low priority for enforcement due to the reason for the diversion."

DESCRIPTION: Greetings, I live on green valley road in Sebastopol, ca. This road floods every time we get a good amount of rain. The county of Sonoma has tried to clean out the creek that runs right next to the road to mitigate the flooding because it would cost too much to really fix the road so it no longer flooded. The issue prompting my complaint is the fact that the property owner - his name is Mark Sanchetti - on the opposite side of the road from the creek has just stated constructing a wall along the road to keep the water and related debris from flooding his vineyard. This Wall would cause the creek to flood more often than it already does and the flood waters would remain on green valley road much longer than they do now. This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE and affects many people living beyond this part of the road.

This business has at least 1 sign in the area advertising water truck services in a mostly agricultural community that relies on the local irrigation canals and has been hit very hard by the continued droughts.

I have attached the photos of the sign from 2018 and now.

I would like to report wasteful water usage at an orchard adjacent to my home. I reported this to the Merced County Public Works and was told that since this property has a groundwater pump that was probably installed prior to permit requirements they have no jurisdiction regarding the enforcement of excessive water usage.

The property APN is 170-070-004. Will you please look into this matter and provide whatever encouragement you can to curtail this wasteful water usage. Additionally, as this pump is not registered with Merced County, I was wondering how the Water Board monitors and regulates the water usage on this parcel in regards to the Groundwater Sustainability Act. The primary reason for my concern is that the water level in my well is more than 8 feet lower this year compared to last. I have become accustomed to overdraft of groundwater but not to this extreme. 

The following picture was taken on May 30, 2021. The runoff is the same now as it was then, the only difference is the weeds are much taller now.

Even though the water source is fully appropriated, a riparian is a property right so the Initial Statement should be accepted by SWRCB.  On November 15, 2021, water right staff contacted Responder regarding the update on the statement submittal.  Responder was having issues with the gallons diverted but after a brief conversation, Responder was comfortable estimating the diversion and use amounts.  According to the Responder, the statement paperwork will be in the mail this week (week of Nov. 15, 2021).

DESCRIPTION: My name is Sarah Windsor and I represent Friends of Mariposa Creek in Mariposa, California. On July 9th, 2020 I observed a Mariposa County employee pumping water from the Mariposa Creek into a county water tank truck. I spoke with the employee Dustin, who said he was pumping many loads from the creek for a public works road project. He stated the tank held 4,000 gallons. 

We know that this is an illegal diversion of water from the Mariposa Creek. We immediately called the director of public works in Mariposa County, Mike Healy and left a message regarding our concern. We also sent him an email detailing our observation of the pumping and our concern. In our email we kindly asked Mr. Healy if he had a diversion permit from the Waterboards Division of Water Rights. Mr. Healy returned our call at the end of the day on July 9th, and stated that he did not have time to look into matter but he would. That was the last communication with Mr. Healy to date.

Friends of Mariposa Creek are outraged that this illegal pumping has occurred and may still be occurring. Summer flows of the Mariposa Creek at this time are extremely low and levels are falling rapidly leaving little for the already struggling wildlife.

During the conversation, Responder explained that an irrigation/groundwater well supples the ponds - not rain or surface water.  Responder continued to say that the watercourse is used for conveying well water to the the ponds, which are kept at full capacity year round.  Responder understands that as long as the ponds are kept at full capacity with well water, the ponds are not within the permitting authority of the state (""in = out"" rule).  Responder also understands that in the event the ponds are not completely full permitting any surface water inflow to be stored, Responder will then be required to file paperwork with the SWRCB, Div. of Water RIghts to appropriate the water.

DESCRIPTION: Observed what appears to be an illegal diversion of water from Alameda Creek.  The diversion line runs from within the creek, across State of California property, into a gas-powered pump, through a hose that was installed through a Caltrans storm water culvert pipe underneath Highway 84, to a private property on the opposite side (North) of Highway 84 from the creek.  The illegal diverter has installed measures to secure their pump to the inside of the culvert pipe and has left a container of fuel in the culvert pipe, which creates a potential for those materials to cause water quality concerns.

To add insult to injury:

TNC takes in hundreds of millions of dollars annually from Federal, State & Local grants for the sole purpose of the eradication of Arundo Donax. In fact, TNC's goal is to NOT perform these obligations under both the grant requirements & their by-laws; they use these plants to diminish the local water supply, which drives down the price of properties that rely on the watershed; and then use these tax-payer funded grants to buy these depreciated farming properties that have now been distressed due to the lack of water.

TNC has over $7+ Billion in assets per their 2019 IRS Form 990 Filing [attached] and someone needs to remind them of their obligations to the Tax-Payers & their stakeholders.
 
This is just (1) ONE example of only (1) ONE local watershed; now multiply this over their national stake-holder ownership of Arundo covered lands; and the numbers involving the depletion of water will scare you.

We took her word for it and for years put up with her trespassing to do work on the ditch without our prior knowledge nor consent. Our biggest concern was when she hired a contractor with large machinery to change the channel of the ditch line and to widen it from a 2 foot wide ditch to a 20 foot wide channel. Also she rerouted East Fork of Indian Creek to feed this new channel. Her actions have damaged our property and the placement of damming materials (plastic sheeting, fiberglass and metal roofing panels) in the creek to guide water into the ditch upstream from our water intake has us concerns as well. On 6/10/ 2021 a local contractor informed us that she had hired him to do major work ( installing pipes) on the ditch again on our property, at that time we informed him that we did not consent to his doing any work. This prompted us to do some research as to our legal rights to prevent this from happening again. We reached out to Craig Kay the Siskiyou county assessor and tax collector who pulled the deed to our property and hers and informed us that she had no water rights nor easement through our property or any other property. Receiving this information we then did research through the California
Water board State water rights division. We viewed the maps form the ewrims gis web site which revealed only three properties had water rights to East Fork of Indian creek and Anne Gould Thomason was not one of them, further research revealed she did not have any water rights on record at all. This prompted us to call the Division of Water Rights to confirm our findings. We spoke with Alex Marten Div. of Water Rights Scientific Aid, he did his own research and confirmed that she is illegally drafting water form East Fork of Indian Creek and has been at least as long ago as 1996 when we took possession of our property. Alex advised us to file this complaint so that someone will contact Anne and inform her that she needs to cease and desist. The water being taken from the creek has no controls and has been used as flood irrigation for pasture fields.

DESCRIPTION: An excavator has been observed digging a pipe line going from Laguna Lake to a neighboring dairy.  At one point the excavator was observed in the middle of the lagoon digging. It is suspected that the farmer is pumping large amounts of water out of the lagoon.  The excavation has likely damaged the local wildlife habitat and will have a negative impact on water quality in that area of the lake. The bare ground from where the excavator dug the pipe line can be viewed by driving up Guglielmetti Road and looking to your left after about 1500'.

In fact, when I bought the property it was at the end of the very long drought, and the stream was flowing normally down the mountain and through my property and the community. In about May or June of this year I noticed that the flow of the stream began stopping and starting. As neighbors we became concerned and we made that concern known on our Community Facebook group, believing that the spring-fed stream was being blocked or diverted for agricultural reasons on the property above ours, where the spring originates. We then realized that the property where the stream originates had been put up for sale, and again hypothesized that the owners were trying to make the financials look as good as they could in terms of revenue for their 70 acres of avocados, I.e. the need to ""buy"" less water from the municipal water company, and ""use"" even more of the spring water they had been using for many many years. On August 4th, I took a real estate tour with my realtor of the property where the stream originates (6036 Rainbow Heights Road, Fallbrook, CA). I have literally never seen so much water on a property in my life.

DESCRIPTION: I have a water right on crow creek which runs along crow canyon rd between san ramon and castro valley. At my point of diversion, three weeks ago, there was a sufficient water to provide for my licensed diversion and still have an estimated 20 gal/minute flow down creek. In less than a day, the creek completely dried up. I investigated the creek flow at locations upstream from my point of diversion that I can reach because there are bridges passing over the creek. About a half mile up the road toward san ramon, I noted that there was a significant flow of water running in the creek under the bridge that leads to the Ma Center and also at the bridge over the creek at the entrance of the Shilow West horse boarding property. From the rapid manner in which the creek dried up and the rapid flow of water less than half a mile upstream, I believe that someone is diverting water from the creek to the point of depriving downstream users of water. Some years ago, I walked the creek from Shilow West to the Hosanna Boys ranch and witnessed a number of diversions. Specifically, Shilow had a well near the bridge within 20 feet of the creek at Shilow West. I also observed a well within 20 feet of the creek at Hosanna Boy's ranch, a number of moveable pumps with intakes directly in the creek. Hosanna's Boys Ranch is located at 9998 crow canyon rd.

DESCRIPTION: Child Complaint = COMP-15456
We urge that the Water Board immediately terminate Water Right #S001806_0. The Water Board eWRIMS website does not describe the point of diversion for Water Right #S001806_01 (Camp Hillwood) and appears to show that the diversion is located off-stream. In fact, the diversion is from a pump placed directly into Conlon Creek, a historic salmon-bearing tributary to Redwood Creek, where both threatened steelhead trout and endangered coho salmon breed. Further, a line from the pump extends downstream directly into Redwood Creek, which is not the permitted diversion site and risks dewatering Redwood during low flows and entrainment of listed species. According to Mia Monroe Muir Woods Supervisor, Camp Hillwood (Hillwood Day School) is out-of-business; their phone number (415-388-0303) is disconnected. However, Ms. Munroe suggests that the pump may still be in use by other residents of Conlon Ave who may have remaining water rights associated with their properties (even though those properties have been purchased by NPS) But even if such water rights continue, they would presumably be limited to withdrawals within the boundaries of the subject properties and would not extend downstream in Conlon Creek and certainly not to Redwood Creek. Further, all these properties are owned by NPS and the un-permitted diversion is located on NPS property. Even if Water Right #S001806 for Camp Hillwood is valid (yet abandoned), it cannot be casually transferred to other parties without Water Board consent. NPS is aware of this issue, which has been on-going for an indeterminate time, but NPS is seemingly unable to address it. Muir Woods National Monument is currently proposing to upgrade and extend its nearby water lines from Marin Municipal Water District, so this could be a timely opportunity to remove the pump and allow any remaining Conlon residential users to connect to MMWD. We urge that the Water Board Water immediately terminate Water Right #S001806_01 and direct any residential users on Conlon Ave to withdraw only according to existing on-site water rights (if any)...or to connect to MMWD through the Monument's proposed upgrade.",Marin,Unnamed stream,Redwood Creek,37.8954,-122.5781,3,,yes,no,Antonio  Barrales,6/3/2020 12:00:00 AM,Gordon Bennett,N,Complainant,"40 Sunnyside Dr, Inverness, California, 94937",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Camp Hillwood / Hillwood Day School,,Respondent,"300 Conlon Ave, Mill Vally, California, 94941",,S001806,,,1,no,Nat'l Park Serv - Muir Woods (property owner),,Respondent,Mail Addr: 2479 E Bay Shore Rd #805  Palo Alto CA 94303,,,,,,yes,1,2,9294,Complaint,3/11/2017,6/3/2020,Antonio  Barrales,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,"Alleging injury to PT resources from Unnamed Stream (known locally as Conlan Creek) tributary to Redwood Creek within Muir Woods National Park.

In January 2017 the home I now own, 621 Hale Ave Morgan Hill Ca. 95037 was completely flooded and had to be completely rebuild to current code due to the flooding of the house due to a different neighbor installing a non permitted covert into Fisher Creek.The owner of 617 Hale Ave is aware of the previous damage by the illegal covert installed in Fisher Creek to my home. Emilio (the owner of 617 Hale Ave Morgan Hill Ca. 95037 ) told me he had permission to dam Fisher Creek by the County of Santa Clara County.I cannot believe the County of Santa Clara Code Enforcement would allow such destruction, his Statement to me cannot be true.The rain is on its way,and I cannot afford to rebuild my home twice or find another location to reside in.

DESCRIPTION: The North Yuba Water District (NYWD) in Brownsville California wants to build a pipe to convey water through a nine mile section of open ditch.  This hand-dug ditch, known as the Forbestown Ditch, was built over 150 years ago.  On July 11, 2019, there was a meeting at the Yuba Water Agency offices on F Street in Marysville, CA.  At this meeting wast the North Yuba Water District General Manager Jeff Maupin, a representative from NorthStar Engineering, the company the District had hired to create the engineering plans for this piping project, and a number for representatives from the USDA Rural Development.  

From a number of emails obtained through Public Records Act requests, it is clear the NYWD was intending to designate the USDA RD as the Lead Agency for the project.  As the federal government Lead Agency, the USDA RD would declare the project categorial exempted under NEPA and, it would follow, also under CEQA.  This attempt to circumvent CEQA was halted when the content of these emails were made known to the Yuba Water Agency.

In June of 2020, the NYWD filed a Mitigated Negative Declaration with ceqa.org.  In August of 2020, this filing was withdrawn.  The concern is, given the history of the NYWD trying to avoid CEQA documentation project requirements, the District might go ahead and begin construction without any environmental documentation at all.  

Another concern is regarding the capacity of the pipe as it is now engineered.  The NYWD has permits for up to 23,700 acre feet of water through Permits 11516 and 11518.  The proposed pipe is designed to convey at maximum of 3,700 acre feet for use by the property owners annexed into the North Yuba Water District.

DESCRIPTION: A blue line stream that is a protected water and habitat area for an endangered bird species runs upstream through the neighboring nursery and into our property and down to Mockingbird Canyon as a tributary. Our local environmental safety board granted water rights to the nursery to use water from the stream to water their 10 acre nursery, probably without knowledge that the stream is protected. Is there anyway to protect the stream, trees, wildlife and the water that provides life-giving resources to the area? They have put in a well with water tanks and we are very worried it will impact the stream's flow. In the past, a property upstream dammed off the flow and dried up the stream, causing the fish, freshwater clams, crawdads and such living there to die. When they moved, the water began flowing again and has for several years now. What recourse do we have to protect our stream? We have used Code enforcement and Fish and Wildlife but they have said their hands are tied because Environmental safety (which protects only humans) has given them permission.

I hold water diversion rights adjacent to my neighbor Delores Dewitt, who's diversion is downstream of mine.  some of her rights are senior to mine and some are junior.  my diversion rights in December are senior and so it is important to receive water during this time.   I believe that the newly constructed/repaired diversion works are located at the following coordinated; 41* 34' 19.75"" N  X  120* 24' 09.00"" W at an elevation of about 4850 ft.  located on the unnamed stream associated with my diversions in Modoc County.  this is my first/only report/complaint at this time as I have not contacted anyone else about it yet.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience that you have received this and if you need further information.  Thank you!

My understanding is thatthe Sweetwater Authority has unanimously voted in favor or draining the Loveland Reservoir in Alpine (SanDiego County) to below currently established emergency levels. I have asked them for a date when theyconsider doing this and they do not respond. They also are considering a feasibility study the have boughtfrom the consultant Gillingham Water Planning and Engineering that includes proposals to drain the reservoirto a very low level which would be absolutely devastating to the fishery and plant and wildlife habitat in thesurrounding environment. Additionally it would remove a vital fire break and diminish the water resourceavailable for fire fighting activities. I am sure there are myriad other impacts that I am not aware of.

I received a public inquiry yesterday regarding Lake Cascade (aka Lake Orinda). The dam and lake are owned by the Orinda Country Club in Orinda, CA. The dam was built in 1935 and is regulated by DSOD, and the lake has a capacity of 111 af.

This aquifer feeds hundreds of protected Heritage Coast Live Oaks and ENDANGERED Englman Oaks, Keys Creek (which has dried up since the boring and dewatering started), and many wells that supply water to orchards, groves and farms, both in the immediate vicinity of the boring site and downstream. They are boring 2 holes approximately 40-45 feet deep and 20-25 feet long x10-15¿ feet wide on either side of the bridge & Creek, then they plan to bore under the creek and bridge at 40-45 feet deep for the length of approximately 430 feet across (under the creek and bridge). At a Valley Center Community Planning Group Meeting tonight, residents expressed that the water levels in their wells have already been negatively affected. Our property runs adjacent to the project area and the creek runs through the back of our property. The creek has dried up and the frogs and wildlife have nowhere to go. Also, one of their boring sites is approximately 30 feet away from our permitted well. SDG&E never notified us in advance about the project, boring or dewatering. They failed to do an Environmental Impact Report, underestimated the amount of dewatering and planned poorly or not at all regarding the dewatering process. They have been forced to stop boring, but they¿re continuing to dewater. They have no suitable mitigation plan, which is extremely destructive. The water is being trucked to a reservoir on a nearby farm. The oaks are now at risk of dying and wells going dry if this ground water is not replenished immediately, being that we are in a drought.

According to the Southern Humboldt Community Park Environmental Impact Report, page 291:
Diversion from the South Fork Eel River infiltration gallery shall cease when the flow at
Sylvandale (USGS Gauge #11476500) is nominally less than 30 cfs.

However, on September 27 of this year, the Sylvandale gauge was reading below 30 cfs: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/uv?site_no=11476500.

SHCP has a history of disregarding rules and permitting. I am concerned that it may be irrigating from the river during this period of low water, high temperatures, and maximum toxic algal growth which are very stressful for native fish. SHCP recently received a grant to develop a water management plan, so this would be a good time to clarify the rules.
Salmon runs on the Eel are strengthening in their recovery, we hope that will continue.

We called a neighborhood meeting for 03/06 to work out our differences. Mr Sharp started by predicting the end of our stream as a viable water source within a decade and then told us it was going to be his way or the highway.

Seeking immediate on-site inspection and investigation to prevent imminent/critical and potentially catastrophic property and home flooding of pond and levy due to an illegal damning of a natural, year-round creek on an adjacent property for the purpose of illegal water diversion and to cause suffering by adjoining property owner.

In late March/early April, 2022, the property owner (Steve Dunn) of 1477 Clark Tunnel Rd began building what amounts to a man-made beaver dam out of wood (1X6 planks & 2X4s), rock, broken branches and mud, in the year-round, natural flowing creek that crosses his property (fed by a continuation of the creek from outflow of my approx. ¼ acre pond). The year-round primary creek, normally around 2+ feet deep, continues across his property and feeds many nearby ponds and a lengthy creek bed that spans many miles as a major food and water source for the area¿s wildlife as part of the area¿s network of creeks. 

The creek is thought to be part of a spill/runoff from miles above me, associated with or near PCWA¿s high above Antelope Canal (per PCWA staff. See Antelope Canal map provided by PCWA), however I have not been able to determine a specific name for the creek, only it¿s origin as best PCWA could determine. According to PCWA, however, the creek is within the jurisdiction of the SWB not PCWA.

Having purchased his 1.8 acre property in 1992 (a partial once part of much larger adjacent acreage; Assessment #: 032-124-017-000. Parcel: 032-124-017-000  TRA: 078157) and then building his home in 2000, Dunn has never utilized the creek for irrigation or any other riparian rights that I am aware of in my 13 years here. 

On the farthest (and opposite his home) SE corner of the property (75-100 yards away from his home and the creek) is an empty, 30-40+ years dry crater 35¿ X 25-30¿ deep, once (I assume) used for irrigation or otherwise for the original expansive ag property. The water table is high enough that the otherwise empty crater holds about 2¿ of standing water in the bottom and was the source of a long-searched for adult mosquito population and a concern by the Placer Co. Mosquito Abatement agent in this area, now treated annually. Until I mentioned the crater and it¿s standing water, they had no idea it was back there and had searched for two years to find this source. 

Dunn¿s home and the creek of concern is located on the opposite NE edge of the property. The majority of his property (lying beyond the creek) that holds the empty crater is tree and root lined, with few areas for sunlight to reach the ground. Dunn (retired now) maintains this land well against fire keeping the weeds mowed, but the land is not suited to otherwise grow anything that requires sunlight. Other than a house cat, he owns no livestock.

WR DESC: While the SWA own the water, it is not superior to their easement obligation to provide fishing access for the public.  The USFS owns this easement.
WATERSHED: 
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: I filed a complaint (COMP-56373 filed on February 23, 2023) but it was closed on April 6, 2023.
 
In the closing of my complaint, the Water Boards said I failed to address certain situations that are within the purview of the Division.  Let me try and address some of those here:
 
1.	Violation of a term or condition of water right permit or license:  It is my understanding that in 2022 and again in 2023 the Sweetwater Water Authority (¿SWA¿) violated their permit/license by releasing water in excess of their permitted allowance.
2.	Waste or unreasonable use of water:  The SWA drained Loveland to dead pool levels in 2022 (never before done in Loveland¿s history) allegedly because of the drought.  In reality, they did not have to drain Loveland completely.  They have access to water from the taxpayer funded desalinization plant as well as ground wells in National City.  The cost that the SWA pays for water is one of the lowest paid by any other water municipality. Also, their supply is up while there demand is diminishing.  Further, the transfer from Loveland to Sweetwater was done prior to the rain and approximately 45% of the water was lost to the ground during the transfer.  Had they waited until the rains came, this loss would have been minimized or averted entirely.
3.	Harm to prior rights:  The Forest Service has held an easement to Loveland for fishing and recreation since 1996.  This excessive water transfer killed all the fish and caused great harm to this pre-existing easement right.  The SWA locked the gates to Loveland in violation of this prior easement right and kept them closed until May 30.
4.	Unreasonable injury to public trust resources:  The primary reason that the SWA owns the former USFS land surrounding Loveland is due to their promise to expand fishing and recreation.  The CEQA application filed by the SWA promises expanded recreation opportunities with five miles of shoreline fishing access during sunrise to sunset.  Over the years, the SWA have eroded their adherence to the terms of the easement causing great injury to public trust.  Further, Loveland was crucial in fighting the Valley Fire.  Had the lake been empty at that time, the firefighting helicopters would have lost valuable time in finding an alternate water source.  Homes were surely saved by having Loveland available so close to the fire.  The residents of the East County have no authority or say in the makeup of the board of directions at the SWA and feel powerless, mislead, and are now victims of a ¿bait and switch¿.  The SWA has held Loveland hostage and the public is left wondering when they will drain it again.  To this day, the SWA will not commit to maintaining the historic minimum pool.
 
The letter I received from the Water Boards closing my complaint said that at least one (of five) situations must be threatened or have occurred.  I have given you four that actually occurred.  Worse yet, the SWA did unmeasurable damage to an established ecosystem of birds, fish, plant and wildlife in the draining of Loveland.",San Diego,To be determined,,32.7879,-116.772,2,,yes,no,Karen  Kramer,6/20/2023 12:00:00 AM,Karen Wood,,Complainant,"19509 Japatul Rd, Alpine, California, ",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,"Hector Martinez, Chairman",,Respondent,"505 Garrett St, Chula Vista, California, 91910",,A010661,,,1,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

DESCRIPTION: San Diego County Code Compliance received a complaint regarding a pump along the Escondido creek near the entrance of the property (just southeast of Harmony Grove Rd). The existence of this pump has been confirmed and record of a permit, purged in 1984, is on file for a pump. Due to the lack of further information it is not possible to confirm if this permit was issued for the pump in question, however it is the only known pump on the property and so must be treated as permitted. The County will not take action against the pump, but, we would like to make the Division of Water Rights aware of this potential water rights violation.

DESCRIPTION: The neighboring private business has been dredging and increasing the size of the manmade lake called Munz Lake, and dumping hundreds of cubic yards worth of fill and debree into our stormwater channels that recharge our lake. Even during the intense drought periods while our natural lake dried up Munz Lake continued to grow in size and depth. Most of my neighbors have reported that their wells have stopped working due to the lowered water levels. This business is also diverting stormwaters that once flowed to our lake and closing up and filling all waterways that and used to carry water to Lake Hughes. Water is being diverted and our once thriving wildlife habitat and lake are being destroyed. Munz Lake is at least 4 times larger than it was in 2012 and much deeper with water overflowing and spilling past the munz lake shoreline. Lake Hughes does not even have so much as a mud puddle today, despite the storms that have filled nearby resevoirs to overflowing. This business, The Painted Turtle has gated and closed off the once publicly accessible property and destroyed the neighboring natural lakes which adds insult to injury. This business has graded and dumped and diverted more than any reasonable share leaving Lake Hughes and Lake ELizabeth both high and dry. Please investigate and make this company stop taking all the water. When we had the powerhouse fire in 2013, firemen bailed water out of our lake to prevent this business from urning to the ground. We are approaching fire season soon and I fear our small vulnerable commmunity is in serious danger as local firement wouldn't assure me they would have access to the waters of Munz lake in a fire emergency as it is private property. The worst part is this business is across the street from our local elementary school and every day the local children see an ever larger more watered lake behind the tall fences, no tresspassing signs and locked gates while the lake they and the entire local community enjoyed is bone dry without even a muddy spot to soil your shoes should you walk over every foot of the lakebed.",Los Angeles,To be determined,,34.6711,-118.43,7,1,yes,no,Kyle  Wooldridge,6/2/2020 12:00:00 AM,Davina Hunter,,Complainant,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,The Painted Turtle,,Respondent,", , California, ",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,10631,Complaint,5/2/2019,6/2/2020,Kyle  Wooldridge,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,"Multiple complaints against the Painted Turtle Camp and other entities.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: While hiking down the recently burned Cozy Dell Canyon area of the Los Padres Forest I came across a recently man-made stone and concrete diversion dam on Federal land. (see attached photo) Following the plumbing downstream I determined that the water was being diverted to a ranch on private property. An internet search produced a link to a Division of Water Resources permit. (https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ewrims/appropriative/docs/a027762.pdf) I noticed however that the permit only allowed diverting the water at specific times of the year.

The groundwater basin has been impacted due to lack of recharge and the water is saline, affecting the overlying property owner well water quality.

Division staff Victor Vasquez contacted the Boos on Jan. 12 and 16, 2018. They said they are original claimants in the Cold Creek adjudication.  They sold most of their property to Nowdesha but have ""rights in perpetuity"" to 4 acres that includes their house.  They said Nowdesha wants to take the water to troughs for 100 cows.  Division records show that the Statement and post-191 water right that were the Boos are now owned by Nowdesha.  Division staff contacted Ms. Nowdesha on 1/16/2018, and she explained that she had explained to the Boos that it is not her intent to deny them water.  She is going to put in a valve that will allow her to water her cows, but there will be water available for the Boos.  She said the valve will be helpful in shutting down the pipe if repairs are needed because the line that serves the Boos can freeze.  Division staff talked with the Boos on 1/17/2018, and they confirmed that they spoke with Ms. Nowdesha on 1/16/2018 and the matter has been clarified and they are no longer worried about their water.

This is my 3rd complaint. All 3 are different areas of district 3 in sacramento ,ca.95833. My husband and I headed out to see more bike trails and river banks in our district 3 after reports to us from neighbors, the level of concern of trash in the sacramento river and the banks from homeless campers. We parked on a lovely street behind downtown ford off 16th. We began walking up the levy. There is so much trash. Everywhere. Old camps abandoned because of all the rain. We turned left and headed tords the biking bridge . There's poles of trash on top. Suitcases,about 5 torn apart bikes,torn apart tv and computers. Looks like people were once removing parts inside for recycle. Lots of clothes. We headed down under the bike bridge to the river bank. There's trash piled on the bank. Bikes in the river,sleeping bags in the river. Tarps and propane tanks. Human feces smeared all over the walls. There's thousands of plastic bags hanging in the trees up high. Tents in the trees,sleeping bag way up high in the trees. The waters going down and campers have started moving back in. They have tents set up and we saw smoke pluming in the air from a campfire or bar bq. There's 2 bridges here. One for the city bike trail,one is wood for the UP and Amtrac. These fires are gonna start a fire for sure. That railroad crossing bridge is in danger . Passengers on trails could be hurt,or that bridge burning would be terrible for transportation. We stopped a few career sport bikers. They had beautiful expensive bikes and all the gear. We asked them there opion on the cituation. One was riding from folsom california, the other from fairoaks,calif. They said it's a tragity what's happened. They cant believe it could come to this. They thanked us for trying to help get help to the area. They weren't hopeful at all. It's been building with no help so far. It was a sad moment for all of us. The city refuses to address how serious the homeless problem is getting. These people need help and need to be removed immediately away from the water and stopped from these fires . Please come look at these accounts and get some photos. Please try to include the mayor and city councilmen Jeff Harris.

I have watched on numerous occasions a white water truck with blue fenders and has TWH painted on the side of the water tank in big letters, pull into an area on the creek, 8031 Lake street lower lake, ca -owned by Opal Harborth, same last name as one of owners of HD EXCAVATING AND TWH EXCAVATING, between the address 8121 lake street. There's is a pump down by the creek with a path through the blackberries with the hose going into the creek to pump the water out of it to fill up with water from the creek...takes about 15-20 minutes and then he drives out to many different locations in Middletown, CA on Highway 29, Clearlake, Ca, Lower Lake on Morgan Valley Road, Clearlake Oaks off of Highway 20 and other addresses in Kelseyville areas. I contacted the number on the truck (707-995-1338) HD EXCAVATING - and talked to Brett Doud, cell phone Number 707-350.3815, and asked them about having them deliver and how much they charge, approx. $280- $320 per load for approx. 3200-3500 gallons. They told me the water was from natural resources and good for plants. If i wanted shower water or drinking water I could purchase water from Clearlake Oaks Water dist and have them deliver it for a added fee or $40-60 because they have to purchase the water. 

I have watched this go on for several years and then i realized that water rights only allow 4500 gallons for domestic use and decided they shouldn't be doing this...its stealing 

On another occasion I called and talked to Travis Harborth 707-328-6048 and he gave me the same basic info to purchase water that Brett and David did. 

I saw the driver and asked him to stop taking water from the lake because we are in a drought. he then threatened me. His name is David Chadwick, approx 5'10"" and about 200+ pounds ... Therefore I would like to remain anonymous because of the threats...

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Since the 1940 Murphy Creek has experienced reduced water levels due to riparian, groundwater and surface water extraction. In the summer of 2001 neighbors reported to me dead steelhead in Murphy Creek, hence Tulocay Creek, hence the Napa River. I reported this to the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Division of Water Rights at the State Water Resource Control Board,SWRCB. DFW began a lengthy and exhaustive evidence based investigation. It took DFW months to walk the creek, speak to neighbors along Murphy Creek and report back to SWRCB that the Murphy Creek was being dewatered for several reasons: riparian pumps and diversions along with groundwater extraction in this watershed. DFW determined that dewatering of Murphy Creek was occurring harming federally listed steelhead. However, the SWRCB months later informed DFW they would not take enforcement actions. DFW without SWRCB collaboration dropped the case and told me that would not spend anymore staff time on Murphy Creek. Over and over again Murphy Creek has been dewatered. Bill and Angela Mink, residents of Murphy Creek have extensive monitoring data on the erratic pumping and dewatering of Murphy Creek in 2009. I worked with the Minks and the SWRCB again to try and get enforcement of the public trust to protect steelhead but non of the agencies would take enforcement action under the public trust . Then the RCD placed a stream gauge in Murphy Creek but a storm blew it out and it wasn't replaced. Around August 4, 2018, again Murphy Creek was dewatered. I reported it to DFW and the SWRCB Division of Water Right/Public Trust Department, Daniel Schultz who assigned this to Kyle Ochenduszko and the DFW assigned this to Craig Weightman. I was told by Kyle to report this to this site.",Napa,To be determined,,38.309,-122.2482,1,,yes,no,Oxcar  Macias,4/1/2020 12:00:00 AM,Chris Malan,N,Complainant,"PO Box 4256, Napa, California, 94558",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Respondent,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: This is a complaint filed by the Bend Water Users (BWU) regarding water rights on Paynes Creek in Tehama County. Our water right number is S000383.

The BWU had experienced a severe reduction in water available seasonally for irrigation since 2014. In 2014, BWU diverted 4200 Acre Feet. In 2019, only 133 Acre Feet was available due to low flows. See attached chart and numbers for annual Acre Feet diverted by BWU 2012 - 2019 per Annual Reporting to the State Water Resources Control Board .

The BWU's initial investigation into this matter revealed that at least 2 ranches upstream may be diverting water from Paynes Creek without water rights or diverting more water than allowed as Paynes Creek runs either through or by their ranch. These 2 ranches are Meadowbrook Ranch, 28125 Hwy 36 East, Red Bluff, CA 96080 and Don and Janelle Kish's Bucking Bull Ranch, 26480 Hwy 36 East, Red Bluff, CA 96080.
The BWU requests that a water rights investigation regarding these 2 ranches and Paynes Creek be initiated and completed by the appropriate government officials.

The ditch water seeping from the unlined ditch is being intercepted by a pump submerged in the Responsible Party's well. A microscopic-particulate-analysis (MPA) of the pre-treated well-water may confirm that indeed the well-water is under the direct influence of surface water.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Hellow, I would like to report an un authorized pumping of water from the Sacramento river. I have a neighber named Milt Eilson that is drawing water from the mouth of middle creek in Shasta County just below Keswick Dam. This creek is a critical spawning bed for endagered salmon. He has no screen and likely no permit. Could you research it for me please. His land does not boarder the river. He has a pipe that runs about 100 yards down the middle of the creek and draws from the mouth. He uses the water for his home and irrigation for a garden. I am an avid sportsman and we can not afford to lose even one salmon. Its bad enough people constantly poach this creek.

I found that although the complaint was against a man named Milton Wilson, I think it is his wife, Sandy Wilson Wolf, who owns the property where the pipe is located.  There are no water rights permits, licenses, or Statements of diversion in the vicinity, and the property with the diversion pipe and the large garden do not appear to be contiguous with either the Sacramento River or Middle Creek, although the respondent does own several adjoining properties that are contiguous with Middle Creek.

6025,,11/20/2019,6/7/2022,,Water Rights - Enforcement,Tomas  Eggers,Victor  Vasquez,Phone call,,,,,,,yes,,,yes,Unreasonable method of use,"Mr. Joseph Mohamed visited the Division file room and asked to speak with someone from the complaint unit to take his complaint verbally on or about November 20, 2019.

Mr. Mohamed alleges that he is injured by Mr. Kurt Hanford's diversion and use of water, though he was unable to identify .  After hearing all of Mr. Mohamed's complaint, enforcement staff believe he may also be allegin that Mr. Hanford's method of diversion is unreasonable because the uncontrolled nature of the diversion causes damage to the levee structure between his and Mr. Hanford's adjacent properties.  

According to Mr. Mohamed, Mr. Hanford constructs a barrier/dam on a flood channel of the Consumnes River, which is located partly on Mr. Hanford's property.  Mr. Mohamed says the channel carries flow only when the Consumnes River is ""flooding,"" and that ""flood"" flows are diverted out of the channel and across Mr. Hanford's property.  Mr. Hanford desires this outcome because as the the flood water passes over Mr. Hanford's property it deposits sand and gravel, possibly from the river or scoured from Mr. Hanford's property, in an artificial depression on the property.  According to Mr. Mohamed, Mr. Hanford sells sand and gravel that accumulates in an artificial depression on Mr. Hanford's property.  Mr. Hanford conducts this diversion each year to replenish the supply of sediment in the pit.  According to Mr. Mohamed, the diverted ""flood"" water is not directed immediately to the pit, but instead flows in an uncontrolled manner that results in erosion damage to a structure located partly on Mr. Mohamed's property.  Mr. Mohamed claims to have invested more $100,000 this year to repair the levee damage caused by Mr. Hanford's diversion.

From the 2nd Restatement of Torts, the Division can consider the extent of injury or damage when evaluating the reasonableness method of use or method of diversion, and the difficulty in avoid such damage.  Mr. Hanford's method of use may be unreasonable.",Sacramento,Cosumnes River,,38.421648,-121.277299,,,no,no,eWRIMS,6/5/2023 2:01:01 PM,Joseph Mohamed,,Complainant,"4405 College Oak Drive, Sacramento, CA 965841",424344,S014195,,,1,no,,,,,,,,,,,Jeannette Hanford Burns,,Respondent,"10865 WILTON RD ELK GROVE, CA 95624",430889,S013944,,,1,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,11727,Complaint,11/20/2019,6/7/2022,Tomas  Eggers,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,"According to Mr. Mohamed, Mr. Hanford constructed a barrier/dam on a flood channel of the Consumnes River, both of which are contiguous to Mr. Hanford's property.  Mr. Mohamed says the channel carries flow only when the Consumnes River is ""flooding,"" and that ""flood"" flows are diverted out of the natural flood channel on Mr. Hanford's property.  Mr. Hanford reportedly does this to cause the deposition of sediment (sand and gravel) from the river or scoured from Mr. Hanford's property, into an artificial depression on Mr. Hanford's property.  According to Mr. Mohamed, Mr. Hanford sells thus deposited sand and gravel.  Mr. Hanford conducts this diversion and use each year to replenish the supply of sediment on his property.  According to Mr. Mohamed, the diverted ""flood"" water is not directed responsibly to the pit, but instead flows in an uncontrolled manner around an artificial barrier that was constructed by Mr. Hanford.  The presence of the barrier causes the flow of the high-flow channel to impinge on and erode the levee that separates their properties.  Mr. Mohamed claims to have invested more $100,000 this year to repair the levee, which was constructed on the property boundary.  Mr. Mohamed, a farmer, has a strong interest in maintaining the levee to prevent crop destruction, while Mr. Hanford's business is reportedly dependent on continued flooding.

Mr. Mohamed stated that he attempted to remove the barrier to prevent the high flows from causing damage at no cost to Mr. Hanford, but was prevented from doing so by Mr. Hanford.  According to Mr. Mohamed, removing a portion of the barrier would eliminate the threat of levee damage without materially affecting the deposition of sediments on Mr. Hanford's property."

The dam is part of a project that rerouted Morrison Creek so that the former streambed could be mined for aggregate and metals.  Granite construction and Teichert Land Co. began construction of an at-grade bypass with 100-year floodplain capacity, engineered wetlands, and riparian corridor in 2006.  Based on aerial images, the bypass was first put into use in 2015.  The planning documents call for the corridor to be held and maintain by a third party, and it was suggested that an endowment could be established, to fund maintenance in perpetuity.  According to Landvision, however, the bypass property is still owned by the two corporations. Based on a review of historical aerial photos from between 1985 and 2021, it appears that water can and does flow in the North Branch of Morrison Creek during the authorized season of diversion. Very few of the aerial photos depicted dry conditions in the channel, but most of those that do were from prior to the installation of the weir. Overall, the frequency that significant volumes of water were observed in the North Branch of Morrison Creek appears to have stayed the same or increased, after the installation of the weir."

PG&E historically diverted water for power generation down a canal. Leakage from the canal for years augmented the flow of Middle Butte Creek which subsequently established a riparian habitat and residents have come to rely on the sustained now for aesthetics and recreation. Division of Water Rights staff learned that PG&E lined the leaky canal to prevent seepage because other residents have complained to PG&E about its failure to maintain the canal. Division staff has determined that PG&E has the discretion to prevent leakage from its canal and is not required to sustain flows in Middle Butte Creek. Division staff does not have evidence to indicate there Is compelling reason to sustain the unnatural riparian habitat and recreation that resulted from the canal leakage in Middle Butte Creek.

DESCRIPTION: MAILED IN COMPLAINT (see attached for a copy of the original): With this letter I have included a 17 minute video documentary of the Kings River. The video illustrates the devastating results of the Kings River Water Association's stewardship of the river. 35 miles of the lower river's ecosystem has been irreparably damaged by water diversion from the river to man-made canals. Diversions administered by KRWA. The lower Kings River has been without water for 4 consecutive years and 5 of the past 6. Our voice and written complaints directed to the Kings River Water Association and the Kings River Conservation District are ignored. It is my hope that you view this video as it better describes my complaint than I am able to pen. The first half of the documentary is a history of the river; the second half illustrates the environmental damage done.

PG&E historically diverted water for power generation down a canal. Leakage from the canal for years augmented the flow of Middle Butte Creek which subsequently established a riparian habitat and residents have come to rely on the sustained now for aesthetics and recreation. Division of Water Rights staff learned that PG&E lined the leaky canal to prevent seepage because other residents have complained to PG&E about its failure to maintain the canal. Division staff has determined that PG&E has the discretion to prevent leakage from its canal and is not required to sustain flows in Middle Butte Creek. Division staff does not have evidence to indicate there Is compelling reason to sustain the unnatural riparian habitat and recreation that resulted from the canal leakage in Middle Butte Creek.

1)	The complaint alleges the water is being ""illegally pumped from Miner's Revine [sic],"" by the resident of 6225 Reba Drive in Granite Bay via a gas pump and a pvc pipe for the purpose of filling a pond.
2)	The address given in the complaint appears to be mistaken, since aerial images do not show a pond on 6225 Reba but do show a pond on the neighboring property 7791 Tall Pine Lane.
3)	In any case, both 6225 Reba and 7791 Tall Pine Lane are contiguous with Miner's Ravine, so both property owners likely can divert under riparian claim of right.
4)	The complaint does not indicate that the flow of Miner's Ravine is significantly impacted by the diversions or that the flow of Miner's Ravine ever stops.  Therefore, the complaint does not provide any information indicating that the alleged diversion and use are illegal or inconsistent with the exercise of a riparian claim of right.
5)	Since the complaint was submitted anonymously, we can't contact the complainant to get information to supplement the complaint.
6)	I did not contact the Complainant (who was anonymous) or any potential Respondent (the identity of the alleged diverter seems to have been mistaken) regarding this complaint, so there is no one to inform of our intent to dismiss the complaint for lack of information.
7)	Therefore, I recommended that we memorialize that we have dismissed Complaint 5735 on the basis of insufficient information.

DESCRIPTION: I live in the town of Yucca Valley and would like to report water diversion although the water is not actually being diverted yet. The steps have been worked backwards and the water lines are all in place to divert from Hi Desert Water District to: Joshua Tree, to use as cooling for a 110 acre solar field. Landers, to use as cooling for a 110 acre solar field. Joshua Tree, to use as cooling for a 55 acre solar field. HDWD has also planned to install 200,000 linear feet of 8-inch pipe that will lead to a wind turbine with the plan to import what 29 Palms Water District calls ""State"" water. Other than the information that I have just written about solar fields the public has been given no other information at all and most people do not know the large amounts of water it takes to cool a solar field. There is just no word from any of the water agencies involved which would be in addition to HDWD, Big Horn Water District, Joshua Basin Water District and 29 Palms Water District. Yucca Valley had 16 water rights holders and according to the 2015 Urban Water Management plan there are now 17. In addition to the water diversion the discord among developers has already cost the town many millions of dollars and the entire Morongo Basin needs the intervention of the State Water Resources Board.",San Bernardino,Unnamed stream,Mojave River,34.117,-116.4544,1,,yes,no,Laura  Lavallee,7/6/2017 12:00:00 AM,Donna Russell,,Complainant,"8169 Church ST, Yucca Valley, California, 92284",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,Hi-Desert Water District,,Respondent,"55439 29 Palms Hwy, Yucca Valley, California, 92284",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,9298,Complaint,1/5/2017,4/24/2017,Janelle  Heinzler,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,Complaint alleging unauthorized diversion for solar panel fields.

Summary of ROI conclusions:
The Kegg Meadow Project reconnects the stream system to its pre-existing historical
channels and does not involve a diversion from a natural channel to an artificial channel.
¿ Groundwater is not stored and later released from storage to apply the water to beneficial
use. Therefore, there is no appropriation of water for which a water right is required.
¿ Even if a water right was required, it is possible that USFS may have a valid pre-1914
claim for irrigation of Kegg Meadow, which may be senior to most of the complainants¿
pre-1914 claims and senior to all the complainants¿ riparian claims.
¿ The impact of the Kegg Meadow Project on available stream flow, and consequently on
diverters downstream, is minimal and represents only 1% of minimum available flows
during the peak flow season (April-June) and 4% of minimum available flows during the
summer (July-Sept)."

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Tip/Complaint received by U.S. EPA:
Lewis Creek is a seasonal freshwater creek that eventually flows into the Herbert Wetlands Prairie Reserve located near Tulare, CA. This creek has had a dam installed by some ranchers upstream who are hoarding all of the water for themselves. It's quite sophisticated with two separate valves they can open to release water at their discrepancy. I live downstream from the dam and have not had water flow the past couple of years. With the drought it gave them the opportunity to further enhance their dam. The wetlands preserve has been effectively cut off from all of the water Lewis Creek used to supply.

DESCRIPTION: I am inquiring into whether or nor the owner of the parcel adjacent to my parcel in Trinity Co has legal rights to water from Little Creek as it goes through my property. I have asked for any sort of documentation for years and have received nothing.
The adjacent property went from mother to daughter in the past year. I was told by the mother¿s late partner that she installed a seep well on my property shortly before I purchased it, thinking that she was going to buy the property.
She has given me differ accounts over the years of how she got permission. One was that the previous owner gave her permission. He did not. Secondly it was deeded. It is not. Thirdly, she got permission from an owner in the 80¿s but lost the note. There are no easements on my property for the seep well or water lines and the other party used heavy equipment on my parcel without my permission while working on the well, leaving the area unusable.
 
I would like to see her application for when she first got rights to use water from the seep well on my property, and secondly, from when she got Small Domestic Use and rights to store (forbearance) and received a grant to install 30,000 gallons of tanks on her property with water coming from the well on mine.

DESCRIPTION: I live in a subdivision in Burson, CA. that has a small lake on it called lake Beth. The lake is split between several parcels and the water rights are permitted to a company that is also owned by the general contractor building the houses. There is a contractor that is paving the roads in the subdivision, and has been taking water out of the lake to use for construction dust control. They have taken approximately 500,000 gallons out of the lake over the past two weeks. It has dropped the lake level two feet. The contractor says that the general contractor gave them permission to use the lake water. Department of Fish and Wildlife game warden William Witzel has already spoke with the contractor about the issue. I have spoke with the Department of Water Resources, Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the county of Calaveras about the issue. Everyone I have spoken with has told me that taking water for construction uses is illegal. The water permit is A009647 and states it is for irrigation use only. I have spoke to all residents in my neighborhood that are being affected. Everyone is concerned about the amount of water that has been taken.

intermittently, for some issues, and constantly for others, reflected the following concerning traits, and has become
suspiciously concerning for healthy, safe and secure household usage. There has been a clear and marked change
in the water quality as I can discern it, as it reaches my unit. The change and deterioration of visual, taste, smell and
possible consumability and useability of the water is concerning from either an incidental/accidental plumbing issue
of malfeseance or mistake (from a main pipe or other intermittent delivery pathway or source infiltration) as well as,
quite feasibly, possibly due to malicious and criminal intentional breach/contamination that specifically impacts my
residential unit. PROBLEM/CONCERN: possible water contamination, via either intentional breach or malfeasance
and poor plumbing impacting water security and quality for resident of multi-dwelling unit. BACKGROUND:
Suspected safety, security and quality breach of water for resident/inhabitant of a ""newly"" constructed residential
building on a repurposed landsite (new apartment building from prior public building site) Building is newly
constructed amd purportedly newly occupied as of 1/28/22 'officially' by residents, with ongoing work, repairs,
refinements, construction, etc occurring as part of regular maintenance, new building work and ongoing
maintenance. Some of the primary infrastructural providers include 20/20 plumbing services, as well as contract and
onsite service providers and maintenance. The building has onsite management, as well as a general
facilities/maintenance phone number for contact. There are general contractors as well as residents and other
element onsite and proximal to the building that may have, be allowed, or given as well as those that may breach or
usurp illicit access to water provision points (internal and external to the building overall, from the boiler room to the
direct access water pipes to each building, and as well, as determined by my water quality-my unit specifically. I
have advised management about such issues in a timely, consistent and persistent manner as contextually
appropriate and have patiently waited out for the water quality to change and not become potentially hazardous or
detrimental. The water quality has not gotten better and as such, I am submitting this problem/complaint for
assistance. SUMMARY: In brief: Building occupied 1/28/22, water quality appeared standard and potable for use.
Initial issues: -no hot water in bathroom shower at all, lukewarm water in some faucets (1 bathroom 1 kitchen) -hot
water subsequently provided to bathroom shower, but hot/cold ""cartridge"" installed incorrectly, had to be ordered and
switched so directional water temperature designators matched (hot upper, cold lower as per shower rotating nozzle)
-shower water ""cartridge"" was switched/flipped or ostensibly corrected. Hot and cold water flow matched faucet
""design"" direction, normal water temperatures achieved, standard shower operation. -Approximately 3 days after
shower cartridge was corrected, and nearly immediately after there was substiantial roof activity, intermittent late
night building activites roof and otherwise, as well as external construction work occurring (extensive ground drilling
and reports of flooding and a main water pipe issue requiring such substantial work/rework fr this newly
constructed.building)... the water quality of my particular unit, 4th floor, changed dramatically, discernably and
concernedly. Generally- When discernable, there are excessive chlorine smells sourced from ALL FAUCETS and
water outlets including clearly discernably from shower run, toilet flush and regular aerosolizes from toilet flushing.

WATERSHED: Mark West Creek
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Realizing that Mark West Creek is one of five priority stream systems identified in the California Water Action Plan, we thought we should bring this to your attention. Starting in March/April of this year, new owners (since October 2016) started bringing onto their 80+ acre property a daily flow of multiple cars of workers, numerous trucks bringing building materials and supplies, a large excavator, backhoe and other earth moving equipment. Several deliveries of concrete were made as well as dozens of dump truck loads of what appeared to be top soil. No building permits have been issued by the Sonoma County. The owners do not welcome visitors or discuss their project with the neighbors. This parcel is significant for a number of reasons. The headwater of one of the two branches of the North Fork of Mark West Creek begins on the property. The property contains a documented Native American archeological site of major importance along with the springs and wetlands that once supported that population. The springs and wetlands are important biological resources supporting flora and fauna. A large scale grow could divert spring flows that support wildlife habitat and contribute to late season stream flow supporting endangered salmon. After another new neighbor, on a hike, became disoriented and wandered onto the property, and was able to report multiple new buildings, the neighborhood at-large decided to report this issue to our Sonoma County Supervisor. On August 11, 2017, Sonoma County Code Enforcement Officers (as well as the Sonoma County Sheriff) were able to enter the property. They found multiple buildings built and being built. They ordered the work to be stopped. However, they allowed the owners to continue to grow their illegal cannabis crop. For some unknown reason, in spite of the extensive environmental and safety concerns described to Sonoma County, neither the CDFW nor the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board were included as a party in the county's site inspection. The county seemed only interested in building permit violations. Incidentally, Sonoma County zones the property RRD B6 100, RC200/50. We had presumed that the RC designation (Riparian Corridor Combining Zone) would have triggered either or both involvement of /contact with the CDFW and NCRWQCB. The attached files reflect the relationship of the property, the property owners, and their cannabis dispensary business in the City of Berkeley CA. Note, the property is owned by three individuals; however, their dispensary, Patients Care Collective, is owned by their corporation, The Team Handed Corporation, and all three are the only officers of that corporation. Also note, one of the included documents announces their new cannabis products from Foxworthy Farms. Foxworthy Farms is described as exemplifying ""patient focused medical agriculture. Located in a beautiful hill top valley in Sonoma County, they farm using fresh spring water and ancient soil.""

DESCRIPTION: Watercourse behind complainant's house (McDonald Creek, Trinity County) frequently shows signs of impact during cannabis growing season. Property on School Road, then Pony Express way after Burnt Ranch School. Creek water used for domestic water supply. Stream originates on Hennessey Peak. Water tested higher up, but not farther down. Creek is trib to Trinity River. Complainant moved to the property in 2003; in late fall, creek was running strong. As years have gone by since then, more cannabis cultivation upstream and diminished flows. Used to be fish, but now not so much. Particularly in the past 5 years, complainante has found pipes, ferts containers including one full of human waste, garbage/refuse. This year water is running at a trickle, looks foamy, and smells foul. Across Creek, growers have removed vegetation. Complainant has observed a hose in watercourse from one property. Complainant reports cannabis cultivation occurring on several properties upstream.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: I am writing to you today as a long-time resident of the Mt. Shasta Valley area, specifically the Mt. Shasta Vista subdivision. This is one of many expansive areas taken over a few years ago by the Hmong drug cartel's illegal pot growers. It's estimated they are currently growing well over 100K plants on over 1000 parcels in this subdivision alone. They don't dump trash, instead, burn it at night. They don't use septic, instead they use the bushes. Rats and mice are out of control. They do use illegal pesticides and fertilizers unapproved for commercial growing use. Their plants are all being watered by hauled water from 2 agricultural wells owned and operated by Grisset Hay. The local Sheriff has estimated they are pulling more than 1 million gallons of groundwater per day out of the aquifer in published statements. As they expand their operation, and they are!, wells will struggle and the aquifer I would think would be in danger. Why is nothing being done about this situation that is endangering our watershed? Is it legal to pump and sell as much water from the ground as you want, which is essentially stealing a public resource for your own gain? While I understand the legal issues concerning abatement and the growing itself, I don't understand how this ranch can be making probably millions of dollars selling our water to a drug cartel. And, if they aren't supposed to be, someone sure needs to look into it!

Complaint:
APN: 221-061-036 This property was allowed the use of a shared spring for their cannabis grow. the only reason the allowence happened was becasue Cheri Sanville -Senior Environmental Scientist Supervisor signed off on the application from John and Nocole Keenman for altercation of streambed for use of cannabis WITHOUT a visit to the site...60 days passed and they did not make it to the site. So without a second consideration the Keenmans get to use the spring for their ILLEGALLY permitted grow.
This spring is low in the fall and is shared between 3 properties In my knowledge of water for use in cannabis it is to be stored and no flowing spring is to be tapped from May - October 221-061-036 uses this spring full time.

Country Estates.(KRCE) Let me provide some background: It is a rural community comprised of hundreds of 1-5
acres lots, some even larger. All of the lots depend on well water and septic tanks with leech fields for disposal. Our
community has become a haven for illegal marijuana cultivation. The majority of the ""growers"" do not live in our
community year round. They own lots and live in tents, shacks or travel trailers during the growing seasons and
leave after harvest. We have been informed by law enforcement that the growers work in concert with the Cartel
moving the ""product"" to the mid-west for sale. The County Board of Supervisors has strict growing requirements and
unfortunately the growers in our area fail to meet, keeping law enforcement overwhelmed with their eradication effort.
I am providing this information for reference only. One of our Count Board of Supervisors suggested I contact you for
help. Violation: An individual that owns or rents property in the KRCE, see below, is drawing precious water from a
well we believe was drilled under false pretenses to provide unlimited water to their illegal marijuana grow, on the
property. . Two major concerns we have. Wasting our precious water resources and ground water contamination
through the use of chemicals used in the cultivation process. As I mentioned the parties come and go often selling to
other individuals. Please see the Unit number, Lot number(s), APN# and owner of record. At the end of Cougar

Subject: Distribution of well water to illegal Cannabis grows

I live in Siskiyou County, more specifically in the Klamath River Country Estates. Our community is an HOA and has recently invoked restrictions and in concert with Siskiyou county to restrict marijuana grows, allowing limited grows under specific conditions dictated by the county however there are some growers that have circumvented the law by installing wells under the premise of building permanent structures, homes which never occur. There is such a case where in area where a well was dug and is currently providing water for local, illegal grows. Law enforcement is overwhelmed with numerous grows in our community with locals selling water from existing wells for profit. In this case a ""grower"" was able to obtain a permit to sink a well with the intent of providing water to illegal cannabis growers. The owner of the well is currently growing on their property, illegally and providing our precious water to other illegal grows in the area. Our law enforcement is focused on larger grows and simply have their hands full. We are reaching out to your agency to see if you can assist us to eliminate the wasting of our water to provide profit for illegal cannabis grows, in our area.

DESCRIPTION: Hello my name is Christopher Wilson I live at 16095 lake Mathews Dr, Perris, CA 92570. Altman plants keeps us awake almost 24/7. big rig trucks honking their horns at 3am back up beepers from dusk until dawn.large generators or machinery running in the middle of the night vibrating our windows and walls with an audible tone like your on the bottom deck of a cruise ship next to the motor room. when the big rigs drive by are house vibrates like an earthquake is coming we have cracks in are foundation, driveway, ceilings and exterior that I have patched dozens of times but keep coming back. hundreds of cars and trucks with their workers drive by dangerously fast passing each other in front our home. Two years ago we got a notice on a Friday night that they would be spraying pesticides from a helicopter less than 200 feet from our front door. I filmed the whole thing including the agricultural department workers who I had come out to test my home.They paid me 50 dollars for the hoodie I was wearing and then destroyed it. the test came back positive on our house but in my opinion the whole report was falsified I have it all on film they have it spraying away from are house in the report which is false. are house was supposedly hit with the least toxic chemical which i do not believe for 1 minute also they told me that Altman's and the helicopter company would get a minimum fine of 5000 dollars a piece. the helicopter company was the only one fined 1000 dollars. they are up here breaking every law in the book and getting away with it. and now I here they want to house dozens of imported truckers and workers to live directly across the street from our home like slaves? so they can party on Friday nights.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: About 2 weeks ago CA Fish & Wildlife raided an illegal pot grow in Lewiston, CA (APN 025-350-52 & 025-350-53). Plants, processed pot, and cash were confiscated. The owner has bragged he doesn't care and will not stop. It has been reported that there are 40+ pot plants in the ground again. The side of the mountain has been graded without a permit and the grading included decomposed granite. He has no State Water Board permit and no permits for anything he is doing. He is using tanker trucks to take water from the Trinity River for water. There is a home at the base of this grade and I worry for the safety of the people who live there. I know the Trinity River is listed on 303(D) list as an impaired due to fine sediment. The grading that has been done is within the watershed of the Trinity River and will make it's way to the waterway. I am also very concerned about pesticides and poisons used in the production of pot and the impact on wildlife and the environment. This area is in an Opt Out area for commercial grows. What is going on is illegal and detrimental to the ecosystem. I contacted F&W to let them know he was growing again and I got the following response from a DeWayne Little at F&W. He replied, ""I am well aware of this site. We executed a search warrant on the parcel about a week ago. We will wait about 30 days, and if we have time conduct a revisit.""

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Neighbor's parcel #220-252-034-000, owned by Harold & Mary Neufeld, has been in the process to obtain a cannabis permit. This parcel is located on Redwood Creek, a tributary to the Eel River and designated a priority watershed. In late December they removed the existing greenhouses, bulldozed parts of the property, removed fencing and pushed all into giant (presumably) burn piles. Then, just before this last rainstorm, trucks with trailers carrying loads of materials, and other heavy equipment (backhoe, forklift, bulldozer, etc.) arrived. The created a road along the stream bank to access this new site. For the following two weeks, they began erecting even larger greenhouses, with two now up and it appears, two more to go in. They have caused extensive damage to the land with water runoff going directly into the creek during recent rainstorms. They have caused severe damage to our jointly used gravel/dirt driveway. I was told that the Neufeld's sold this property 1/10/19 and the new owner's name is Monica Mohr. Last Thursday, 1/17/19, Humboldt Co. Planning & Building Dept. placed a stop work order on the property. Friday afternoon, 1/18, a well drilling rig was brought in and set up. Monday morning they started drilling. I am very concerned about the evident, environmental destruction they have caused and the immediate effects on Redwood Creek. I have heard fish spawning in the creek. As this watershed has been designated a critical, priority watershed, it seems highly inappropriate that a commercial cannabis operation located within the historical flood plain on the creek bank would be allowed to operate or granted a permit. I would like someone to immediately come and inspect this operation and ultimately, be denied a permit to operate a commercial cannabis operation at this location. As this property is located directly off the county road, I am also gravely concerned about my personal safety with a commercial cannabis operation so close to my home. Briceland is a small residential community and this operation should not be allowed to operate so close to other's homes.",Humboldt,To be determined,,40.1069,-123.8991,5,1,yes,no,Christopher  Borsh,10/9/2019 12:00:00 AM,Joan Courtois,N,Complainant,"PO Box 285, Garberville, California, 95542",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Harold & Mary Neufeld,N,Respondent,"PO Box 670, Redway, California, 95560",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

Complaint:
GREETINGS! I am a resident of Siskiyou County and have been for for the last past 5 years. I will be very transparent here and try not to be long winded. I hope to clearly convey my opinions, observations and fears in this correspondence and hopefully shine some light, get some much needed attention and help to overcome and address these many issues our community is experiencing! I consider myself an ordinary person, older(over 50)married,semi retired and my husband and I made the choice to move and retire in the ""what was,once"", a beautiful high desert area within Siskiyou County. This area has shape shifted gravely over the past 5 years, having a huge impact on the residents that call Big Springs there home. In just one year, the massive explosion of the illegal marijuana grows has become an industry, here! the grows that once dotted the high desert landscape, sparsely have grown 10x in size, the uncaring people that tend to these grows, have migrated to this area and no longer migrate out after there harvests. Thousands of greenhouses that have been erected now allows them to grow year round and yield high numbers of plants. They continue to rape the land of all its resources. Ruing the land by cutting down all the native trees, brush,etc clearing large plots, using deadly poisons, spewing sewage and large volumes of garbage in the area.

I reviewed Landvision and based upon 2020 aerial imagery don¿t see and obvious water truck operation associated with a surface water body, but we should do our diligence and contact the complainant and Lieutenant MacDonald with DFW to determine if this is a surface water diversion being used for water hauling for cannabis cultivation- It does look like a pond may have been developed adjacent to the main road, but I see no surface water source near it that would facilitate diversion to the pond. We may also want to contact the Shasta River watermaster to see if they know anything about this property and its water sources-

Hi Stormer,

I just got off the phone with Lieutenant McDonald of CDFW in Siskiyou County and an activist in the Shasta River watershed. The activist stated that there is a water truck that is making repeated trips in and out of a parcel that is along the Shasta River. The presumption is that, the water trucks are headed to the Shasta Vista cannabis grows but that hasn't been established yet.

It seems like we will have to establish a few things, are we sure water is leaving the property and not coming in, is it a groundwater pump that is sourcing the water, is it actually taking water to cannabis grows.

Is this something that you are interested in looking into, or I can also try to establish a few more facts first. The Shasta River is watermastered so the next step I see is contacting the watermaster.

Let me know what you think! I know you responded to complaints regarding groundwater pumping to water trucks to Shasta Vista cannabis grows so I wanted to at least let you know and or coordinate.

The person who took the photo is a neighbor and said the property only has a domestic well so assumed the pump necessary to fill a 4500 gallon tank, based on time on the property, must be the one he has in the river/riparian."

To Whom It May Concern;

I'm curious to understand how the City Council and Planning Commission keep approving large cannabis grows without thinking about the ramifications to the health and safety of the residents. Please address unlimited licensing and building of cannabis/hemp cultivations in the City of Adelanto.

""Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Report In the past 10 years, the City of Adelanto¿s population has grown by more than 25% (U.S. Census). The City¿s current water treatment system, already straining to accommodate Adelanto residents, will not supply enough water for incoming businesses and continued population growth. The following is a summary of the needed repairs and updates (Type 1 and Type 2) associated with the water system, the estimated cost and status. These repairs and updates are essential to the future of Adelanto¿s water supply. Below is an updated list of the CIP items""

I look forward to your communications, further questions, and answers.

This complaint has to do with an existing well pumping water from an area very close to a cluster of springs and two streams which supply domestic water for a dozen properties down stream. The springs and streams arise from the parcel adjacent to where the well is located. It is only a few hundred feet away. The water users have senior water rights recorded with the SWRCB since 1993 and before. In December we learned the owners of the well property have applied for a new permit to grow commercial cannabis. The problem is no well study has been done to prove that the well is not hydrologically connected to the surface waters. Its located at an elevation that leads us to believe it will take our household water when they begin to pump 1800 gallons a day during the driest months of the year. We were not informed of their plans until one week before the permit was to approved.

While hiking near Three Forks, south of Ruth, in Trinity County, I stumbled upon a large cannabis grow operation. It included seven large (25¿ x 100¿?) greenhouses set up on terraces cut into a steep hillside, a number of water tanks, and a large pipe (16¿?) installed upright in the upper Mad River, with a smaller pipe (6¿?) inside. There was also a similar sized pipe of corrugated steel culvert material in the river as well.

Normally this property is behind a locked gate, but it burned in the August fire, and the destroyed home was being actively remediated as a hazmat site at the time.

The Trinity County assessor¿s office has provided AP numbers, so I was able to track down owner¿s name and addresses. The property is located in Section 24, Township 27N, Range 12W (Diablo), on a Forest Service road called 27N53, also known as Anna Grace Lane. Street numbers on Anna Grace Lane are 851, 1111, and 1280, according to Parcel Quest. I believe 851 Anna Grace Lane, parcel 021-190-011-000, is the recently active grow. The other two parcels may have been used and remediated; it¿s hard to tell because of the fire clean-up, which was in progress at the time. If there were hazardous chemicals, the FEMA cleanup contractor may have records.

Here¿s the problem: By all appearances (water pipes between the grow and the creek, water tanks at the grow and at least one pressure tank by the creek) water is being stolen from the creek on parcel 061-640-013. It is a 1.36 ac parcel with an owner assessment mailing address shown in Sutter, CA. We believe water is delivered from 061-640-013 to the large grow on parcel 061-540-056 (12.39 acres, owner assessment mailing address in Tyler, TX). It is our understanding (from speaking to a California Fish and Wildlife warden) that the large grow is operated by Mexican nationals with criminal records. It is our understanding that the owner of the Canyon Creek parcel is also Hispanic, but we do not know if there is some arrangement for water between the two owners. Butte County code enforcement has not recently sited the owner of 061-640-013 for any violations. According to the warden I spoke with at Fish and Wildlife, the Butte County District Attorney was proceeding with litigation against the owner of 061-540-056 in 2020 prior to the North Complex West Zone (Bear) fire. After the fire, all litigation efforts were abandoned. Since some of these pot grows are obvious, enormous, and international, many of our BCWU members do not understand why nothing is being done at a federal enforcement level. State and local agencies do not think they can deal with the problem, for various reasons.""

Hello this is Maria I. Ponce. I placed a call and left a message regarding my neighbors stealing my water. I did receive a call back from Tanya but unfortunately missed the call. I have this property in Mad River parcel # 208-241-011-000. I want to first apologize because I believe there is an outstanding balance on my account. And I have fallen on some tight financial times. Which is why the property is up for sale and had been fire months now. My business partner who was the one basically financing everything was falling behind on everything, even with the consultant who was helping n that became a bitter situation in which I don't believe everything with the grow project was correctly closed out. I also discovered that my partner was not completely being honest with me about the grow project, so I had him terminate the whole project and that is when I put the property up for sale. I had been connected to the new neighbors with the help of Ms Abigail Strickland from the Humboldt Planning and Building department. I had one conversation over the phone with a 'representative' of my neighbors where he said that they wanted to discuss a possible arrangement with me for my water, to help them with their grow because apparently lack if water was a major problem fir them the previous year. I have always believed that the truth is the right way to go. So I made the mistake I believe by telling the representative, whom I have forgotten his name, that I truly knew absolutely nothing about how these arrangements work or how much to base a deal on or anything. I also mentioned how I would never know if I can ever make it up the mountain with my ford fusion since the road is pretty ugly in some areas. I was told by the representative that I would be hearing back from them after he discussed it with the neighbors, which never happened, even after I left 2 more messages and text to him. So I assumed they were not interested. Well I decided to risk my car and go up to the property to simply check on things on August 27th. And good thing I did because people have been up there helping themselves to some of my equipment, who I can't say for sure who since there are no cameras up there. But I did also find my water line was being redirected into the neighbors land!? I took the water line completely out of my water tank and took several pictures along with a video of what I found! I also unfortunately fell and fractured my wrist in 2 places that day at the property so that is why it has taken me this one to report this. I am still trying to adjust, but the first week I was in a bit if pain to where that was all I was focused on at the moment. I did however go in to the building and planning department and spoke with Abby 'Abigail' and showed her the evidence I had. So consulted with her supervisor and was told that although in their records it shows the neighbors do not have a registered grow and aren't supposed to, even with the evidence presented, that this was a matter fir the water board. I would appreciate that they be held accountable and assume responsibility, as anybody should really! There are processes for a reason! But mostly, they had more than a promising chance of being able to use the water had they communicated with me in a professional manner, which the opportunity was definitely there! But instead they chose to illegally enter my property and steal my water! If you would like you can contact Abiagal Strickland for verification or simply to inform you of which neighbors I speak of. Her email is astrickland@co.humboldt.ca.us

As the growers have been preparing to start growing again , they have recently excavated to create a pond around the spring to effectively dam up the creek.

Complaint Summary: ""Dear Sheriff,
I am an attorney in Santa Rosa, with a client, Julius Marks, at 1000 Foss Road, Kneeland. A neighbor,
Seth Lancaster has admitted to tampering with Mr. Marks water system, and disabling it. Mr. Marks now
has no source of safe water. The water system servicing Mr. Marks house is by definition a ""Public Water
System"" per Health and Safety Code section 116275(h).
Tampering with a public water system with intent to harm is a felony. (H&S 116750) The intention of the
tampering was to disable the water to Mr. Marks residence. It is hard to imagine how this is not intent to
harm. Mr. Marks now has no water to his house and is using water from a local pond to live. I suspect
that if someone disabled the water off to the Sheriff's house the Sheriff would consider this harmful. Mr.
Marks considers the lack of clean water to his toilet and his sinks and shower to be harmful.
The neighbor was acting individually, and on behalf of the Mullen Road Mutual Water Company, a
corporation. Mutual Water Companies are subject to the cited code sections per California Attorney
General opinion letter (26 Ops Atty Gen 7.) There is no ""civil"" exception to the Safe Drinking Water Act.
There is no court order allowing the water to be disabled. And, there is no claim by Seth Lancaster or
the Mutual Water Company that Mr. Marks is doing something that allows them to disable his water.
The Legislature has found and declares that ""Every resident of California has a right to pure and safe
drinking water."" (Health and Safety Code section 116270.) What does this mean to the Sheriff's Office?
On behalf of Mr. Marks I am asking the Sheriff to enforce a felony violation of the Safe Drinking Water
Act. This is an ongoing and urgent matter.""",Humboldt,To be determined,,,,1,,no,no,Scott  Shironaka,8/23/2022 12:00:00 AM,Julius Marks ,Y,Complainant,"1000 Foss Road, Kneeland, CA 95549",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,Seth Lancaster,,Respondent,"1011 Foss Road, Kneeland, CA 95549",,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

Complaint: Hello, I am a resident of an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County west of the city of Lancaster. It is my
understanding that no recent permits have been issued for legal Cannabis or Hemp cultivation in my region.
Recently, this region has experienced a surge in illegal Cannabis operations. This has caused a significant increase
in water usage (334%) as well as water theft. Community members are also concerned about the use of pesticides,
illegal dumping of refuse and an increase in criminal activity. There are over 20 grow sites within a five mile radius of
our community here in Neenach. I am hopeful you can assist in directing me to where and how I may file a formal
complaint regarding this matter. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Gary Allison 25505 West Avenue

""I understand it's the holiday weekend but I wanted to reach out to you with a vivid memory of what we discovered on
July 4th. We hung out on the river yesterday where we spend most days and could not believe the low water level.
We found dozens of 12 inch large carp that are trapped in these shallow waters. It's a sad scene to see. With the
water level quickly going down we took a walk up the river to see if something had changed. Sure enough, we found
a barrier man made dam diverting water that had been completely rebuilt. The handful of boards that were being
used to divert the water are thrown in the middle of the river where the river is drying up. New black plastic tarp has
been put in. Instead of the boards diverting the water there are now large rocks that have been stacked up and
covered in fresh concrete cement. CEMENT! Some one has poured cement in the middle of the river to help divert
water into their direction. The trash from the cement bags are just thrown on the side of the river. Again, this is all
being done on vacant lots and we believe the water is being diverted to help cultivate a resident's marijuana garden.
I've contacted the Sheriff's Office, Bureau of Water Resources and Fish and WildLife and they have all referred me
over to CalEPA. We understand the lack of rain water is out of everyone's control however this man made dam is
becoming more and more obvious that it is not legal.

The claimant Identified 13160 McCourntey Road, Grass Valley, CA as the alleged location, but aerial imagery showed no evidence of cannabis activity. There appeared to be cannabis cultivation activity present on an adjacent property 13038 McCourntey Road. Both properties are owned by the same landowner, John C Meirana. 

John Meirana applied for a water quality permit on 3/21/21 via the Cannabis General Order online portal. The application identified the cannabis cultivation site as APN 053-260-038-000 (13038 McCourntey Rd, Grass Valley, CA 95949). It further lists the entity cultivating cannabis as ""AgSoul, LLC"" and the contact person as John Meirana who is likely the business owner. The application checks the project's water source as groundwater well and water purveyor. Aerial imagery did not reveal a groundwater well completion report related to the APN.

DESCRIPTION: Bulldozing in of pond. Resident near violation contacted me with primary concern that pond provides water in case of fire. Found me via my website. I offer biological services. Am known in the community. Told her I would assist if she would file complaint. As is common. Declined. I am doing it for her/as a concerned resident/biologist myself. I have been visiting this area for 20 years. The corridor in which this pond occurs is a riparian corridor along the South Fork of Wolf Creek high in biodiversity. It provides habitat for listed and sensitive species including yellow breasted chat (confirmed breeding), yellow warbler (sighting), willow flycatcher (potential habitat). Pond had nw pond turtles and habitat appropriate for Ca black rail and potential habitat for globally imperiled (on the verge of extinction) Scadden flat checkerbloom (private land so not confirmed; habitat was appropriate for this species). Local populations of waterfowl very common on the pond. Pond has been there for at least 50 years according to resident, likely longer. Not a new feature. Additional concerns, filling pond in during winter rains. Tremendous release of sediment if it floods now. Potential black rail habitat was bulldozed out of existence/filled in.

WR NUMBERS: 
WR DESC: Don?t know
WATERSHED: Mt. Shasta
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: We live very close to a spring creek that flows from the side of Mt Shasta.  Squaw Valley Creek is running at an all time low for this time of year.  There are several cattle ranches that this creek flows through or nearby. Last season, the lessee of the Johnson Ranch (Lazy W), who has obvious water rights, placed the boards in their diversion dam in late May and took water continuously until very late October.  I estimate that they are diverting on average about 3-5 cfs from the creek that is running around 12-15 cfs. When they were not distributing this water over the ranch they let it flow through the property and is dumped it back into the creek after being polluted with silt and excrement from the cattle. A rough estimation of 1,500 acre feet is being used to water pasture for cattle. If the source waters are being depleted and the quality is being neglected, there is little hope for our rivers and water infrastructure. 

With higher flows last season, the effects on the stream were a very noticeable drop in flows and a large rise in the temperature of the water.  This year, the effects will be greater due to the diminished flows. 

While I respect the right of land owners to exercise their rights to waters flowing through their property, I believe that there should be some oversight to keep the resource from degrading.  This creek is the largest tributary of the McCloud River and there is little interest from state agencies in protecting the resource. 

I have reported incidents of pollution from motor oil being dumped in it to raw sewage from upstream residents that either have no septic systems or ones that don?t work. There seems to be little interest in exercising some changes or corrections. 

The insatiable demand on California?s water resources needs to be addressed with a major focus on the headwaters and watersheds of the Shasta/Trinity areas.  Creation of more storage has little value if we don?t protect the sources of our water system.

DESCRIPTION: Karen Mogus, Deputy Director Division of Water Quality State Water Resources Control Board 1001 I Street Sacramento, CA 95812-2815 Complaint about Polluted Pasture Runoff to District Ditches, Orchards, Deer Creek, and the Sacramento River March 17, 2020 Dear Ms. Mogus, Two Assessor Parcel Numbers divert excessive amounts of surface water from the Deer Creek Irrigation District, then discharge water carrying cattle manure to District canals, onto other properties, to lower Deer Creek, and into the Sacramento River. The APNs are 079-040-084, which is ranched by John and Linda Pitter, and 079-040-18, ranched by Sue Knox. This discharge is a potential threat to human life and property, and endangered salmon species. In addition, this discharge could destroy the economic value of orchard crops if E Coli contaminates orchards. Summary: Remedy for Water Pollution and Discharge Onto Other Properties ? The discharge from the Pitter and Knox properties must stop. ? The Pitters and Ms. Knox must install water recirculation systems to prevent future uncontrolled discharges. ? Surface water must be diverted onto the Pitter and Knox properties in quantities that will not cause discharges. ? These cattle ranches must test and certify that any discharge, whether from irrigation or rainfall, is clean water. Waste has been discharged from these ranches for decades. Complaints from neighbors and landowners to the west have had no success in convincing the landowners to modify their irrigation or waste discharge management practices. Recent changes in orchard farming require orchardists to certify that no animal manure enters the property. Nut and fruit processors inspect properties for reasons including whether manure or feces are in the orchards, especially near or during harvest time. There are many cattle ranches within 20 miles of this location that recirculate water and do not allow discharges of water or manure to other properties or into streams. However, some ranchers are resistant to change, and want to ranch the same way it was done 100 years ago. In the last years many environmental laws have passed requiring better control of waste from animal ranching operations. The University of California, Agricultural and Natural Resources, have held countless training sessions and field days to teach ranchers about new laws, better practices, improved economic practices, environmental laws and considerations, and fines and penalties that may be assessed for violating these laws.",Tehama,To be determined,,39.95238,-122.012741,2,,yes,no,Jeffrey  Yeazell,9/29/2022 12:00:00 AM,,Y,Complainant,", , , ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,"John & Linda Pitter, Sue Knox",N,Respondent,"5380 LEININGER RD & 5065 GOLONKA LN, , CA, Vina, California, 96092",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,11902,Complaint,3/20/2020,8/12/2020,Aaron  Feldhaus,Water Rights - Enf - SV,,,"Allegations of excess polluted ranchland water runoff.

DESCRIPTION: I live in the Twelve Bridges area of Lincoln CA, and they¿re constructing a new road to service 300-500 new homes in a large open space with wildlife, wetlands, and ponds behind my house. Currently, there is a mitigation pond with a lot of plants and wildlife in it. The pond feeds a natural stream and wildlife area that ends up in a larger pond downhill, in the same open area. The new road is 30-40 feet away from the pond, and there¿s a natural spring further up from that, that the construction crew put a piece of plywood over to divert the water down a trench. Worse, the builder and the City of Lincoln have publicly stated all this was based on 1998 general plans and that they do not have to do updated EIR¿s, so I¿m really concerned they¿re running rough shod over everything, hoping no one will notice. I'm also worried about road pollution run off into the pond, streams, and any underground streams, as well as into the open wildlife and plant areas.

DESCRIPTION: I am uncertain what to do about a very serious problem where I live. Last summer, our well lost pressure, and it ran out of water a few times.

When water and pressure dropped, my well (I am a widow) and line were checked at least twice for problems; none were found. We moved here in 1987 and have always had good water, even in severe drought that occasionally lasted 2 or more years. The Seely property surrounds this small parcel, and along with their wells they have access to, and pump water from, Middle Creek. Their land is on both sides of the creek for long stretches of creek bank. I was told that they have lowered their trap for pumping from Middle Creek, with the implication that they are pumping when water is running. Due to soil changes since the Ranch fire in 2018, runoff water runs more freely.

WR DESC: taking 100% of the water leaving Bailey Creek to go dry
WATERSHED: 
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: To Whom It May Concern,

We are residents of Shingletown, CA  96088.  We currently reside near Bailey Creek.  Due to the climate change, Bailey Creek over the last few years has been dry beyond the 2nd diversion for most of the summer into early fall.  This is largely due to the diversion of water taken by Maurice Johannessen and the Christian Camp in Viola.  We understand that they have water rights dating back to the 1800's, however things have changed greatly since that time.  We have no where near the abundance of water that we once had in Bailey Creek.  With a lower than average snow pack and drought conditions we are asking that a revision be considered in the amount of water that they are allowed to divert.

It is our understanding the PG&E has the right to divert water from Bailey Creek at 20 cubic ft. per second into the Loomis Mill Ditch from January 1- December 31 for electric generation. This, with the private diversions is leaving us with a sterile, dry creek.  

With the drought and high fire danger in our area, having no water in the creek leaves us with no wild fire protection.  If there were water in the creek we could use it to help with fire suppression if a fire occurred.  The lack of water is also causing an adverse impact to public trust resources (fish and wildlife).

It is our understanding that besides having some kind of water right, a diversion requires a Lake/Stream Alteration Agreement.  This agreement is to protect the fish and wildlife on any diversion of any stream.  It is our understanding that this agreement can limit the season in which you are allowed to divert water, as well as the rate and quantity of diversion.  One of the most common LSA terms is a forbearance period in which no diversion is allowed for several months during the late summer and early fall, when stream flow is naturally the lowest.

We would like our concerns to be investigated.  We are asking that the private diversions be regulated so that 100% of the water is not being taken leaving Bailey Creek dry for several months out of the year.  This was a creek that once flourished with fish and wildlife.  It is now sterile. The current system benefits a few and hurts hundreds.

DESCRIPTION: From email to EXEC:
Hello All,

Thanks again for your assistance Beba.

Little Creek is a year round creek that runs parallel to Christian Valley road in Auburn.  I believe its origin is a spring in the vicinity of Hidden Valley Rd.

This  creek has never run dry in the summer months until 2 years ago.  There are several ponds that have been installed in the stream.  Over the past 2 years from June through mid-late September, the stream dries up.  This has had a major adverse effect of vegetation and wildlife.  The stream passes through our property on 15051 William Drive and meets Orr Creek behind our home.  I believe both systems a tributaries to the Beer River and/or the Sacramento River.

The curious observation is that the creek starts flowing again at the driest time of the season, right before the rainy season begins.  The flow coincides with Fall harvest, when irrigation water is no longer needed.  Interestingly, the up-stream ponds have remained full during the dry periods and have never gone dry.  These ponds have also greatly increased in size over the past several years (1580 Christian Valley Road dredged the pond 2 to 3 years ago).  It appears when the water is no longer needed for irrigation purposes, the stream flows again.  This is not a mighty river and it would not take much diversion or pumping to impact flow.  Happy to elaborate more but something is amiss and several down-stream neighbors are concerned.  We would like to have an investigation done.

We have also been in communication with CA Fish and Wildlife.

DESCRIPTION: Hi - I live along Christian Valley Road in Auburn, CA.  We live along a year-round creek in which it appears water is being diverted.  The creek has never run dry and over the past 2 years starting in Jun - late September, it has run dry and all wild-life along the creek is suffering.  Interestingly, each September, around harvest time and before the rains, the stream starts flowing again.  Fish and game is also investigating but asked me to contact Ca Water.  Up stream there are various new ponds and the existing ponds have significantly grown in size.  These ponds are never dry during the summer season and I believe they are pumping the creek dry or diverting the natural flow.",Placer,To be determined,,37.98734,-121.062527,1,,yes,no,Zach  Mayo,6/2/2023 12:00:00 AM,John Stuart,N,Complainant,"15051 William Dr, Auburn, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,NA,N,Respondent,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,11900,Complaint,4/22/2020,5/26/2023,Zach  Mayo,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,"5/18/2021 - ZMayo - No inspection has been performed as of 5/18/2021.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Bud is stealing water from a spring he has no legal rights to. Bud has been reported by other neighbors for stealing water from the Trinity River without permits, as well as been reported for having a illegal Marijuana grow. His adult son whom has multiple warrants out for his arrest has been seen spraying water until the water line runs dry. Just to waste the water and upset the neighbors. He is also been reported for attacking neighbors with objects. Bud and his family has no regard for the environment and are very close to the river so contamination of the Trinity River could be an issue. And would need to be looked into. I am unsure of Bud's legal name or if he has any warrants. He has disclosed he is not the legal owner of the property but that the legal owner is aware of his grows. He is paying for the property by growing illegally and selling the product. It does not appear that Trinity County Sheriff's have taken any actions on his grow at this time. Bud is living on less than an acre and has over 50 plants.",Trinity,To be determined,,40.5843,-123.1465,1,,yes,no,Oxcar  Macias,4/3/2020 12:00:00 AM,Michelle Gaitero,N,Complainant,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,"""Bud""",N,Respondent,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

I followed it to its source, which is approximately the center of Section 11, T17N, R13W, and just across the City¿s property boundary.  There appears to be an illegal conversion as I see cleared (burned) timberland (and per George Randar of CalFire no conversion permits exist in the area).  The muddy water is actively eroding down the face of newly constructed dam on an in-stream pond, which is fed from a second pond also located in-stream.  I also noted a third pond which is in the head of a swale, does not appear to be connected, but exhibiting an overly steepened dam face which is ripe to blow out (onto the City¿s property).  There is one hoop house on-site and workers appeared to be constructing a second.

The reason for my concern and according to the Garberville Sanitary District annual reports they submitted for 2018, for both their water diversion license and permit, they now lose over 14,700,000 gallons of water they divert from the South Fork Eel River, which is 1 Million gallons more than for 2017 and why I submitted my complain, i.e. they are losing more water, not less.

Please see attachment, its the difference in blue, between what was diverted under their license and permit (raw surface water) and or sold thru a meter (treated water). 

Here are the links to their annual water diversion reports (2018) submitted 3/31/2019; both contain a link to the attachment I provided:

https://rms.waterboards.ca.gov/LicensePrint_2018.aspx?FORM_ID=393499

My question now is the same as my complaint stated last year (COMP-39893); the lose of 14.7 Millions gallons of water from the South Fork Eel is not a beneficial use, whom does it benefit?

I know this process is complaint driven. However, I have taken the time and expense to follow the complaint process, to no avail, while literary 14 Millions gallons of water a year are going unchecked, mishandled and squandered on what? Rather, the water should be benefiting the Threatened, Endangered and Evolutionarily Significant Units and species, i.e. Coho, Chinook and Steelhead salmon! Notwithstanding, the South Fork Eel is itself listed under the state and federal Wild & Scenic River Act and Endangered Species Act for which it is protected.

This magnitude of water loss is not water under the bridge or the assumption and theory this water loss is ""acceptable""; it should be treated as a crime!

Failure to provide safe potable water as per California's passage of Human Right to Water in 2012. 3) using pond water without first modifying existing diversion permit. 4) altering the banks of the pond to install treatment facility without a stream bed alteration permit hence violating CEQA 5) discharging filter plant effluent/backwash waste directly back into the pond 6) diverting water from a surface water without any metering device 7) storing waste asphalt grindings without ""Best Management Practices"" (BMP) in place for erosion control and contamination 8) failure to construct roads using waste asphalt grindings in a manner approved and required by CALTRANS where the waste asphalt grindings are used as base material only, and then capped with approved road material. failing to do this has allowed waste asphalt to enter waterways hence violating CEQA 9) prior to 2010 this entire community was part of a State Public Water System known as Fort Ross School District using a water source named Forry Pond. The school drilled a well and separated from the rest of the community and the remaining residents kept using the Forry Pond w/o Government regulation. Since the separation the landlords were not regulated and the remaining residents suffered with improperly treated surface water and tenants children did get sick and others complained. Some were evicted because they complained about the bad water. The landlords lied about the number of remaining houses and Sonoma County Public Health did not take over to ensure safe water was maintained. 10) illegal residents, building and additions installed without permits 11) new buildings installed and wired, resulting in seriously overloaded electrical service panel.

WATERSHED: Austin Creek, which is a tributary to the Russian River
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: The property where the violation occurred is known as Rogers Ranch. Rogers Ranch did an unauthorized alteration of the Main Spring which is the source of the unnamed stream that flows through Double K Ranch riparian property (""DKR""). The stream is designated 50-ft Riparian Corridor Combing Zone, RC-50. An excavator was used to alter the spring, the surrounding area and the natural stream course within the RC-50 zone without a Streambed Alteration Agreement with the CDFW and without a permit from the Sonoma County Building and Zoning dept. A french drain and new spring box with a cap on it were installed to allow for the unauthorized diversion of non-riparian properties that do not have legal water rights. A new road was built and a new dam was installed, which altered the natural stream flow. A livestock pond was installed which contaminates any available water that may flow to the downstream DKR riparian property. These acts damage the riparian rights and interests of DKR and the certificated rights of DKR/Davis/Lowell. Rogers Ranch is allowing others to deplete the natural flow of the Stream which harms the public trust. A biologist study was conducted and the stream contains special-status aquatic species, including California Giant Salamander and the Foothill Yellow-Legged Frog. The spring-fed perineal stream also makes contributions to Austin Creek, an important stream for the coho salmon and steelhead trout. Due to the alteration, depletion and contamination of the stream, the Complainant DKR is unable to access its riparian and appropriative water rights at the point of diversion in the stream on DKR property. On 8/30/20, the stream flow on DKR was only 1900 gallons per day, which is well below DKR's Certificate D1138 right of 4500 gallons per day and to support minimum in-stream flows. The riparian and appropriative rights are negatively impacted, and the health of the riparian stream and wildlife are threatened.",Sonoma,To be determined,,38.5542,-123.1035,6,,yes,no,eWRIMS,6/5/2023 2:01:01 PM,Katherine Kemerait,N,Complainant,"1065 Church Street, San Francisco, California, 94114",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Kathleen Peterson,N,Respondent,"19832 Alana Rd., Castro Valley, California, 94546",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,12225,Complaint,8/31/2020,,Sahil  Pathak,Water Rights - Enf - NC,,Medium,"9/16/2020 - Complaint filed on 8/31/2020 against a neighbor property alleging development around spring box (altering the defined channel flow).

DESCRIPTION: Stream flows in the Shasta River under the best of circumstances are woefully inadequate during the irrigation season. They require a programatic approach when they fall disasterously low as they did in the days around around 7/23, 7/30, 8/15 and especially 9/10, when flows were allowed to drop well below 20 cfs, in a river whose unimpaired flow would have been around 150-200 cfs at those times i.e. less than 10% of the natural flow was in the river to protect public trust resources or maintain adequate water quality. While the river is largely under watermaster control, the water master has no guidance of how much water should be left instream, so does his/her best to reduce it to zero. In the absence of an adequate flow study, some approximate minimum flow should be specified by Cal EPA to protect aquatic organisms. This becomes especially important starting Sept 1 when salmon start trying to enter the river, and find passage inadequate due to diminished flows, and survival of them or their eggs impossible due to high water temperatures resulting from diminished flows. Please at least weigh in on this issue to help the watermaster avoid conditions that will inevitably lead to further fighting over water here.",Siskiyou,To be determined,,41.826,-122.5939,2,,yes,no,Skyler  Anderson,11/20/2018 12:00:00 AM,David Webb,N,Complainant,"PO Box 277, Mt.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: The USFS has a right to flows for fish in Scott River as measured at the USGS gauge pursuant to the Scott River Stream Adjudication 1980 Decree. USGS flow records show that this right is now not met in late summer and fall even in years of average precipitation and snow pack. As measured at the USFS gage, Scott River flows today are below 5 cfs (see attachment). The primary USFS flow right during August is 30 cfs. The USFS is thus receiving less that 17% of its adjudicated flow right. However, while the USFS right goes unmet, irrigation, even in the same schedule (4) as the USFS right, continues undiminished. The local watermaster has done nothing to secure the USFS flow right. Upon my last Public Trust and Water Right complaint in this regard, the SWRCB curtailed surplus rights in Adjudication Schedule 4. However, no one was then taking surplus rights since they were not attainable give the streamflows. SWRCB should have then proportionately curtailed first priority rights in Schedule 4 so that everyone in Schedule 4 - including irrigators and the USFS - shared the pain of inadequate water supply equally. SWRCB did not take that action. I'm asking you now to recognize that surplus flows are not available and therefore are not being taken and to curtail first priority rights in Schedule 4 progressively and proportionately until ALL primary right holders in Schedule 4 are sharing the pain of inadequate supply equally and proportionately. I am also requesting that you take appropriate action to assure that the local watermaster is instructed to and is in fact taking appropriate action to secure ALL rights in Schedule 4 sine that is his/her duty. Also, in light of climate change and the ongoing drought, it is an ""unreasonable"" use of water as defined in the California Constitution for water right holders in the Scott River Basin to continue to divert and use the amounts of water assigned to them via the Scott River Decree. Therefore, in order to enforce the Constitution's ban on unreasonable use of water and to protect and restore the Public Trust in Scott River Basin water, pleaser curtail primary water rights so that the damage being done to Public Trust Resources in the Scott River and its tributaries is curtailed. Finally, as determined in the attached study and as indicated by the UC Davis Scott Groundwater Model (incorporated herein by reference), groundwater extraction has a significant impact on the ability of surface flows to meet the flow rights in Schedule 4 and other schedules of the Scott River Adjudication. Nevertheless, Siskiyou County is currently considering proposals for non-agricultural developments that, if approved, will result in significant additional groundwater extraction. In light of the scientifically established impact of groundwater extraction on surface water rights and the failure of flows to meet even the primary water rights of all water right holders, I ask SWRCB to prevail upon Siskiyou County Government not to approve additional extraction of Scott River Basin groundwater pending adoption of an adequate groundwater management plan pursuant to SGMA. I believe failure of the SWRCB to address and cure the problems identified above, including damage to Public Trust Resources and to water right holders, will lead to a petition to Siskiyou County Superior Court to reopen the Scott River Adjudication in order to adequately address groundwater extraction which is closely connected to surface flows as well as the persistent and progressive failure to meet USFS flow rights in Scott River. I hope the SWRCB will take effective action to make such a petition unnecessary.",Siskiyou,To be determined,,41.72074,-123.01703,4,,yes,no,Alexander  Sweat,2/4/2019 12:00:00 AM,Felice Pace,N,Complainant,"28 Maple Rd, Klamath, CA, 95548",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Respondent,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: On February 9 and 10, 2018 I observed out-of-season pasture irrigation taking place in the Scott River Valley in the Scott River Watershed, Klamath River Basin. The following ditches were being run full at that time even though the only operable water rights at the time are stockwatering rights limited to 2 acre feet or less as per the Scott, Shakleford and French Creek Stream Adjudication Decrees. The following diversions were being operated at maximum capacity: -- Jenner Kidder Creek Ditch observed along South kidder Creek Road, carrying an estimated 5 to 8 cubic feet per second (cfs) -- Jenner Etna Creek Ditch observed where it goes under Lovers Lane near the town of Etna, carrying an estimated 5-8 cfs. -- The Scott Valley Irrigation District (SVID) main diversion ditch from Scott River at Youngs Dam which was running an estimated 8-12 cfs. I also observed flood irrigation taking place at one location along the East Side Road in the Scott River Valley. That irrigation water was being supplied via the SVID main diversion ditch from Scott River. The field being flood irrigated is on the west side of Eastside Road approximately 0.6 miles south of the intersection of Eastside Road and Eller Lane. These conditions are documented via the attached photos which are all dated and geolocated. The practice of irrigating pasturelands outside of the court defined and adjudicated irrigation season is an ongoing practice during years in which there is a dry fall or in which there is limited rainfall. i have complained about this to SWRCB officials several times before and going back over a decade. The local watermaster says he can't do anything because the serviced only operates during the irrigation season. The SWRCB Division of Water Rights has been informed several times and, while they have investigated, they have not taken action to curtail the practice. The failure of the SWRCB to enforce provisions of the Scott River, Shakleford and French Creek Adjudications has enabled and fostered lawless water management in the Scott River Valley. Running ditches full on stockwatering rights and out-of-season irrigation have proliferated in recent years in large part because of the failure of the SWRCB to enforce provisions of the relevant adjudications and California Water Law. I complained directly to the SWRCB's Division of Water Rights this fall about irrigation of pastures beyond the irrigation season. I provided photo documentation. Nothing was done to curtail the illegal irrigation and i again found it happening on February 9 and 10, 2018. This ongoing illegality should end. But it will not end unless the SWRCB requires real and significant consequences for out-of season irrigation. Please investigate and please do what is needed to end the regular, ongoing practice of out-of-irrigation-season irrigation of pastures in the Scott River Valley and the related practice of running ditches full on very limited amount stockwatering rights. There follows a link to the photos i took of the out-of-season irrigation, full ditches and other problems, including on-stream feedlots and riparian degradation, occurring in the Scott River Valley on February 9 and 10, 2018.

We note that 6.9 cfs diversion is enough to support more than 222,979 cattle (three times the number in all of Siskiyou County), which is obviously far more than are actually present on the properties that the Edson Foulke ditch serves. The diversion could and should be dramatically reduced to a reasonable amount (less than 1 cfs) without affecting the intended end use of this water (providing stockwater for a number of cattle which could reasonably be expected to be present on the destination properties), which would have major ecological benefits downstream in Parks Creek including reliable access for Coho salmon migration, spawning, and incubation.",Siskiyou,To be determined,,41.435431,-122.47137,1,,yes,no,eWRIMS,6/5/2023 2:01:01 PM,Craig Tucker,N,Complainant,"1085 I Street, Arcata, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Tim Nielsen,N,Respondent,"PO Box 49, Gazelle, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: The Scott-Shasta Emergency Order from SWRCB curtailing irrigation in the Scott River Basin is being violated and SWRCB Water Rights Enforcement is not doing anything to find and end the violations. 

Violations of the order include:
     1. Local Cooperative Solutions are not being followed.  Irrigation is occurring in Scott Valley as in a normal year.  
     2. Cheating is widespread. Here is an example of how some of these guys are working the system.  From 2009 to 2020 the Farmers Ditch Company reported the number of cows being watered as 1000; their report sent in on 3-23-22, reported that the herd count had doubled to  2,000.  I believe they are lying; please investigate. Here's the link to their reports: https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims/listReportsForWaterRight.do?waterRightId=29683
     3. In addition to Farmer's Ditch lying about the number of cattle being watered, I am specifically complaining about Roy Johnson, who farms just south of French Creek who is irrigating daily using french Creek water. Johnson also leases a ranch on Miners Creek (French Creek Tributary) and irrigation is going on at that ranch as well. 

These are just two examples.  The Valley is full of egregious violations of the Emergency Order.  I believe the SWRCB is doing more damage than good. By refusing to enforce the order they are undermining respect for the water rights system and SWRCB water management, as well as encouraging others to not comply. 

In spite of the curtailment flows at the USGS Scott River gauge have continued to fall and the rate of decrease appears to actually have increased since the curtailment. I believe that indicates the curtailment is not being enforced. Please investigate and get those responsible for water rights enforcement in Scott River Basin to do their jobs. Either way, more action by the SWRCB is needed, including cancelling those groundwater agreements that allow irrigation to continue and on which cheating is occurring. DFW is supposed to check compliance with groundwater extraction agreements but that is not occurring. Please investigate that too. That groundwater extraction is not being checked by DFW or anyone and cheating is likely widespread.",Siskiyou,Scott River,,41.4887,-122.8402,1,,yes,no,Sahil  Pathak,6/5/2023 12:00:00 AM,Felice Pace,N,Complainant,"28 Maple Rd., Klamath, California, 95548",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Roberto Cervantes and Jule Rizzardo,N,Respondent,", Sacramento, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

DESCRIPTION: The SWRCB has mandated a MINIMUM flow of 50 cfs in the Shasta River.  Lately the watermaster has been treating that minimum flow  like either a target hoping to hit it sometimes, or something to aspire to in the indefinite future.  It appears that the water users, via the Scott Shasta Watermaster District are testing just how far they can deviate from the SWRCB mandate.  We have a watermaster to manage stream flows and water distribution.  She gets paid extra for meeting the SWRCB mandate, yet we have never had a solid minimum of 50 cfs since early in the irrigatin season, and getting worse over time.  Beyond that, there should be an additional 7-8 cfs of 1707 water from the DFW's Big Springs Ranch that never seems to be instream.  Its loss appears to be outright water theft as often as not.  see: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=11517500&parm_cd=00060&period=14&format=gif_stats",Siskiyou,Shasta River,,41.8264,-122.5906,2,,yes,no,Sahil  Pathak,6/13/2023 12:00:00 AM,David Webb,N,Complainant,"5820 Serrano Drive, Mt.

DESCRIPTION: We either create regulation via a public process and then enforce violations of regulations or we may not as well do anything at all. The state remains complicit in driving coho in the Shasta River to complete extirpation by avoiding stronger enforcement efforts.

I am well aware of the LCS attempt with Big Springs Irr. Dist and the massive failure that it was, but giving away state water (the 1707 water that TNC added to the decree) is quite alarming. As the SWRCB said at the last public meeting for the extension of the Scott-Shasta drought reg's- the river at the mouth should be 50 CFS + the 7-8 cfs TAXPAYER funded water. So if we are not near 60 CFS, then citizens are being stolen from to protect private ranching interests. That does not sit well with me, as a 5th generation resident of the Shasta Valley. I am not against ranching, but I am for environmental justice and equity and the protections that the public trust legally deserves.

The flow came back up early this week, possibly because of enforcement, after the failed LCS effort with actors who do not act in good faith (Tristan Allen). Now it's tanked again.

I attend many public district meetings- GID, MWCD, Scott Shasta Watermaster District- and the things I hear at those meetings would give most people pause in working with them.

According to USGS current flows in Scott River at the gage are 52 CFS; they say this is in the 10-24 percentile for historic flows. The FS right to flows for fish in Scott River as of November 1 is 200 cfs standard right and 158 surplus right. The DFW study calls for 362 cfs flowing down the Scott in November. The mouth of Shakleford is closed and Chinook salmon have not been able to access most spawning grounds in and above Scott Valley. This is yet another step driving Scott River Chinook salmon toward extinction. Meanwhile, many/most/some of those who irrigate pastures from irrigation ditches are running their ditches full or well beyond their stock watering rights and are irrigating pastures even though irrigation should have ended September 30 to October 30, depending on which adjudication is in play.This is not a new occurrence. I have documented out-of-season pasture irrigation for decades now and filed Public Trust Complaints on out of season irrigation with the SWRCB. Below is a photo of out-of-season pasture irrigation from Farmer's Ditch back on 10/30/06. Irrigation was supposed to end 10/15. I've sent several photos of out of season irrigation to the SWRCB including for AP Cattle Ranch. Right now the Jenner Ditch on Kidder is running an estimated 4-5 CFS on a stockwater right that is much less. Some pasture ditch owners have stopped irrigating year around but others have not. Please stop the remaining lawless out of season irrigation which is helping drive Chinook and Coho salmon toward extinction. Watermaster and SWRCB, please check the pasture ditches in and around Scott Valley and especially the AP Cattle ditch on the East Fork and the main Jenner Ditches on Kidder and Etna Creeks to determine if they are diverting more than is necessary.",Siskiyou,Scott River,Klamath River,41.640833,-123.013889,,,no,no,Alexander  Sweat,11/18/2020 12:00:00 AM,Felice Pace,,Complainant,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Respondent,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,11713,Complaint,11/7/2019,,Alexander  Sweat,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,Investigation into 2019 low flow conditions and out of season irrigation in the Scott Valley.

WATERSHED: Kidder Creek
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: The Kidder Creek Orchard Camp (KCOC), located in the Scott River watershed, Klamath River Basin, owned and operated by Mount Hermon, has constructed and is using a pond for which they do not have a water right. KCOC is filling and maintaining the pond by using water diverted from Kidder Creek which they take from the irrigation ditch which passes through the property where the pond is located. KCOC has no right to take water from this ditch. And they have no right to maintain a pond on the property. The pond is a consumptive use due to accelerated evaporation of water from its surface. KCOC/Mt Hermon has also applied for a use permit from Siskiyou County that, if granted, will authorize construction of an even larger pond, presumably using more water from Kidder Creek. Siskiyou County is not requiring that KCOC show that it has a water right for the existing pond and the County is not requiring that KCOC/Mount Hermon shaw that it has a water right for the larger proposed pond. Therefore, this complaint is against Siskiyou County (for not requiring that applicants for Use permits show that they have a sufficient water right for the proposed use) and it is against KCOC/Mount Hermon for operating a pond without a right, for taking water from Kidder Creek without a right, for taking water from the Kidder Creek Irrigation ditch that runs through their property without a water right and for wasting water by operating a pond without a water right. KCOC is also in violation of the California ESA because taking Kidder Creek water without a right leads to a longer period during which the Creek below the diversion is dewatered. That results in ""take"" of C-ESA and ESA listed Coho Salmon. Each year fish are stranded below that ditch and die, including juvenile Coho salmon. KCOC taking Kidder Creek water without a right , and also that organization's extraction of groundwater that is interconnected with surface flows, also contributes to the fact that adjudicated flow rights in the Scott River not being met in summer and fall even in average water years. Therefore, KCOC/Mount Hermon's taking of water without a right contributes significantly to the degradation of Public Trust Resources, including C-ESA listed Coho salmon. Therefore, this is a Public Trust Compliant as well as a Water Right Complaint.,",Siskiyou,To be determined,,41.5285,-122.9525,1,,yes,no,Alexander  Sweat,11/18/2020 12:00:00 AM,Anonymous,Y,Complainant,", , , ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Respondent,"2700 Soiuth Kidder Creek Rd., Etna, California, 96027",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,9800,Complaint,8/22/2018,,Alexander  Sweat,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,Potential unauthorized reservoir

DESCRIPTION: The Complainant, Lynda Davis, submits this complaint and requests that the SWRCB investigate the legality of certain water diversions made by Don Elder and Patricia Stock from Complainant¿s property. 

The water source is located in an above-ground mine shaft (¿adit¿) on the complainant¿s property, which is located on Quartz Hill Road near Fort Jones, CA (Siskiyou County Assessor¿s Parcel No. 024-061-400). Complainant purchased the property in 2021. After purchasing the property, complainant discovered that Don Elder and Patricia Stock, the owners of the neighboring parcel (APN: 024-061-410), maintain a diversion from the adit.   

On November 30, 2021, Elder and Stock filed a lawsuit against complainant (and other co-owners of complainant¿s property) which sought to obtain a prescriptive easement, or in the alternative an implied easement, to a water right that would authorize them to continue diverting water from the adit (¿Complaint¿). The verified Complaint is attached as Exhibit A.

-	The Complaint describes this water source as ¿groundwater accumulated in a pool formed by a man-made dam at the mouth of the adit.¿ (Exhibit A, pg. 19, ¶ 4.) 

-	Elder and Stock contend that, since May 11, 1971, they have ¿enjoy[ed] continuous unfettered use of the water [diverted from the adit] at all hours of the day, every day of the year.¿ (Exhibit A, pg. 20, ¶ 7.) 

-	Elder and Stock contend that, ¿use of the water, adit, and water line has been exercised daily for the fast fifty years,¿ and claim ¿a prescriptive easement or prescriptive water right.¿ (Exhibit A, pg. 20, ¶¶ 23-24.) 

-	On June 17, 2022, Elder¿s and Stock¿s attorney, Martin Andreas, sent a letter which state that ¿the water in the adit does not meet the definition of water as set forth in Water Code section 5100(c).¿ The June 17, 2022 letter from Martin Andreas is attached as Exhibit B.

-	In response to written discovery, Don Elder and Patricia Stock stated, under oath, that: 

(1)	the ¿taking of water from the adit is not a diversion per the definition provided by CA Water Code 5100(b).¿ (Exhibit D, Response to Special Interrogatory No. 1.)  

(2)	they do not possess riparian rights nor SWRCB issued water rights and do not file statements of diversion and use with the SWRCB. (Exhibit D, Response to Requests for Admission Nos. 4-6.) 
The discovery requests and associated responses are attached as Exhibits C and D. 

Based on the foregoing, there is a question whether the water source is subject to SWRCB authority and the adjudication, or whether it is ¿groundwater accumulated in a pool¿ ¿ as Elder and Stock claim in their Complaint. 

Since purchasing the property in 2021, the Complainant has observed water flowing downhill over the mouth of the manmade dam towards the watercourse known as ¿Custer Ditch¿ which flows into Oro Fino Creek, a tributary of the Scott River. Representative photos are included as Exhibit E. Additionally, a USGS Map of complainant¿s property depicts a watercourse located on the property that flows into Custer Ditch. The USGS Map showing the property with demarcations showing the approximate boundary of complainant¿s property is included as Exhibit F.
 
	Based on the foregoing information, Complainant believes that a question exists as to whether Elder¿s and Stock¿s diversions are subject to the SWRCB¿s authority and permitting requirements. Complainant respectfully requests that the SWRCB consider performing such investigations as the SWRCB believes may be necessary or appropriate to resolve this question.",Siskiyou,To be determined,,41.5856,-122.923,2,,yes,no,Sahil  Pathak,5/23/2023 12:00:00 AM,Lynda Davis,N,Complainant,", , California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Don Elder / Patricia Stock,N,Respondent,"10400 Quartz Mountain Lookout Road, Fort Jones, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

DESCRIPTION: Hello,  

I'd like to remain anonymous. The individual I'm reporting is really well known and has a lot of connections in my small town. That being said, Jim peluso located at 2007 Sawyers Bar Rd, Etna California 96027 has diverted most of Whiskey creek into his field and ponds via a ditch. As a consequence, my neighbors and myself have been left with dry wells.  We used to have water in our wells year round, now we run nearly completely out in April. I get about 10 gallons a day from my well and this is the same for my neighbors. Not only are we suffering as a result,  the trees in our yards are starting to die as well.

They divert the water apparently to 2 holding ponds. They will completely divert such that the creek runs dry. When they have their fill, they let it run again. This creates havoc with wildlife- including such things as tadpoles - that surely die when the creek goes dry. Are they allowed to do so? The creek will run for a day or so, then be dry. Then water again a day or 3 later. Eventually the creek flows into the Ventura River that runs through Ojai to the ocean. My phone numbers: work (805)642-9283; cell (805) 320-0067.

The company diverts water from the Osco Creek using a pump and pipe. Greg provided pictures and a video from the diversion and pinpoint its location.

I Would like to bring to your attention the water diversion and changes made in my neighbor¿s property for his purposes of a grow site.  In their most recent request for rezoning to expand their grow, they did not mention many important changes made to the property.
 
Well over 100,000 cubic yards of dirt have been moved in the past 18 months with up to 6 earth movers, truck and personnel working full time. NO permits were taken out for this work.   If you do a simple google earth search you will see 18 to 24 months ago there was a small 3 acre pond.  Now there is a 10 acre pond.  In doing this, they covered up the Rindge #1 Mine. From https://www.mindat.org/loc-75837.html   Workings include underground openings with an overall depth of 225.55 meters and comprised of a 740 foot, double compartment, vertical shaft. Crosscuts were driven on the 200, 400, 500 and 700 foot levels, totaling several thousand feet.
This mine is now under this 10 acre lake.  Who knows what might be percolating up.
I have witnessed water being pumped out of this new pond into a water truck.
 
In the Whiskey Slide request for rezoning to expand. 
¿	NO mention of the over 1 year of dirt work done to expand the pond. And that they have filled up this mine under this new pond.
¿	NO mention of the terracing for the grow they did. Moving tens of thousands of yards of dirt. You can view history of Google Earth to see what they did. In this terracing they cut into about 6 springs that now drain under their plastic coverings of the earth for the grow.
¿	NO mention they removed an older single family home, made pile of it and burned it about 100 feet from my property line. Concerns of asbestos?
¿	NO mention they removed burial rocks from a historic grave site, or that the grave site was even there.
 
There are currently about 2000 grow bags in place.  Each plant will use about 900 gallons of water during the 180 grow season.  This is 10,000 gallons of water a day.  A single-family residence uses about 171 gallons a day.  I own 3 wells on my properties within 1500 feet of this grow.  Where is the 1.8 million gallons of water needed to grow these plants going to come from?  And not affect our wells?  
 I don¿t know what you perhaps can do but wanted to bring it to your attention.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: My neighbor is currently using surface water from the creek to raise wild trouts without any permit. They irrigated the water to go into the pond, which they dug a hole(no permit for grading). They won't show me the pond so I don't know exactly how many trouts they are raising. They irrigated the water from the creek to divide into two ways by blocking the middle of the creek with a big rock. The water goes into the pond then goes back out to the creek. They are contaminating the water by feeding the trouts and blocking the waterway. The pond is close to my backyard so when there is heavy rainfall water sweeps soil off of my backyard. I currently need to build a retaining wall because of them. They are contaminating the water which San Bernardino residents use and they are making a profit by using water for free. This is unacceptable. They did illegal grading, using water without a permit, disturbing natural habitats, and contaminating water with fish food. It is very urgent and needs to be addressed accordingly. I can not see this to be continued. They made this pond at least 2years ago and it is now eroding my back yard when there is a rainfall. They never show me the pond but I saw them digging a very big hole. My neighbor is inviting people to have a group party at the creek every day. They use gas grills and small burners to cook on the tables placed on the creek. They are using the grill next to my house so I'm worried if they will cause a fire when there are fire warning over the mountains. They dump waste and grease from the grill into the fresh running creek water. They leave trash behind. They party everyday especially during weekends so the smoke comes up to my back yard and they don't listen to my complaint. I'm worried about fire, dumping at the creek, and the noise they make. Please have them use grills at their back yard, not on the creek. I filed the complaint with code enforcement but no one came. I want my information kept confidential. Please investigate this issue.

He has an easement for a road/driveway to his house and he drives over the bridge over Franz Creek every day.  He says he saw it go from free-flowing to completely dry in the two days that they pumped their well, a well that is 50' from Franz Creek (within our regs of a minimum of 30' - but I don't know if it's a high volume well) to fill their irrigation lake from pretty full to really full.  He says they ripped out all but 13 acres of vineyard to replant, and that 13 acres is on dripline that he says shouldn't need that much water.  He feels it wasn't right for them to pump the creek dry.

The land was ideal for a community park and I set out to build it. The stream flowed continuously and became the focal point with its waterfall and shallow waters for kids to play in. The creation of the pond brought many families and children. The teens began coming as a place to hang or gather. Most warm days saw 50 to 100 people who were all appreciative of the local swimming hole.        This all ended with the nearly one mile of plastic lining to the Upper Centerville Canal installed about 2015. The stream known as Middle Butte Creek went dry with no flow at all. The sounds of the waterfall were now non-existent. The pond went from 15 feet deep to less than 4 feet. The stagnation of the pond proved to be the end of Community participation. Some years, as in 2023, we have an abundance of rain and the stream flows and the pond fills. But, it is short lived and quickly dies as the season heats up.     This loss for the community of Magalia is a direct result of the non-replenishment of the groundwater table supplied by the Upper Centerville Canal built in 1911. Many complaints of animal deaths due to their inability to climb up the plastic have also been registered with F&G. No one can deny that the plastic lining is directly responsible and should be removed immediately to restore the flow and make the Park whole again.     I have reached out to multiple agencies through the years and have found no one to champion this cause. PLEASE if there is any way you can help us, the community of Magalia would be deeply appreciative.",Butte,To be determined,,39.8519,-121.6077,1,,yes,no,Lang Khang,6/14/2023 12:00:00 AM,Kris Nikolauson,N,Complainant,"14988 Nimshew Road, Magalia, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Joe Wilson,N,Respondent,"350 Salem street, Chico, California, 95926",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,15029,Complaint,5/21/2023,,Fernando  Salcido,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,Assigned to Fernando Salcido on 6/14/2023.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Calaveras County Water District (CCWD) has been made aware of a potential illegal diversion and/or use of water from Bear Creek in Calaveras County (County), a tributary to the Middle Fork Mokelumne River. Information was provided to CCWD via its anonymous ""drought and water waste"" phone line by a County resident. According to the complaint, a person at 1462 Palmer Road in West Point has allegedly blocked Bear Creek flow and has been diverting water for on-property uses and may also be polluting the downstream waterways via irrigation waste discharges. CCWD has not attempted to verify given its remote location and concerns for staff safety. CCWD staff review suggests there is likely no basis of water right for any Bear Creek diversions or storage downstream of CCWD's diversion rights and facilities used to supply its West Point Service Area. As such, this diversion may be adversely impacting other water users in the Middle Fork Mokelumne River Sub-Watershed.

The creek is the lifeline of the entire ecosystem of our parcel and we take our responsibility as stewards of that ecosystem very seriously.

John Calvi informed us that the rights were granted in a deed which permitted them access to our property for the purposes of extracting the water.
Being new to the area we took him on his word and continued to have very cordial relations with him. He invited us onto his property where he showed us the large water storage tank which the pipes from the concrete dam was feeding through use of gravitational pull.

There are two very politically powerful families that own vineyards near mine.  These are the Fords and the Berras.

My pond is lined and I do capture rain water.  However, the flow from the seasonal stream this past winter was almost non-existent.

On the north side) okay, so, we have a piece of machinery submerged in the creek/River itself., dug out his ditch, just because he has deeded rights, does not mean he can change the land. The ""access"" includes ( I believe?) In the last 7 years , since he originally bought this ranch, he has dug 5? Holding ponds/mini lakes, some as much as 40' in depth, all within ancient river beds ""oro fino creek"" which the over flow from his aquifer provides the houses passed his property with water. But since he has so many ponds, these houses currently haven't seen a drop since before the end of last year. I can only imagine what this is doing to the frogs, pollywogs, steelhead, and possibly salmon, all of which I have found in his wheel lines at the furthest north end of his property. This year is the first year I've seen his aquifer double in width, and deeper by at least 30' and is already 3/4 the way full., with seeing 100% of the water coming in, and zero water passing through to the next properties. He build a dirt bike track on top of this old river bed, as well as piping 6' underground in order to reduce the natural flow of the creek, to siphon ALL of the water in circulation from his inlet, to the north end of the property and the pipes it back into his aquifer. And I believe he installed new pipe this last year to 100% control the water that flows from kidder creek, and I suspect this, because in previous years you can see the water flow day and night in the ditch, and visibly see the changes in the landscape/wild life, this year his aquifer is almost 3/4 of the way full with absolutely zero waste going to the foliage and landscapes. Possibly a large intake pipe at the edge of his property straight to his aquifer. Directly next to this old creek bed, does Mr. Collenberg, has three large fuel holding tanks that leak, as well as 20+ leaking diseal trucks, and a few broken down semis.  With buried truck parks throughout his property. I do have several photos and some videos of these heinous water crimes. He recently graded/tilled/ and seeded a 40 acre parcel directly above an ancient water bed, that used to have a constant stream of water. At one point 3 years ago he dug a 80' wide 40' deep hole to pump the ground water into his aquifer to reach his bale count for the year, and somehow had enough water this year to be farming into late October, which is 100% unheard of in the valley, especially during a massive drought year.

Along with the pump by the creek is a 1000 gallon diesel tank that has no protection from leaks. If the tank were to be punctured it would leak into Horse Creek.

WATERSHED: Los Gatos Creek
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Ms. Ingram-Cauchi (Respondent) claims the right to divert water from Aldercroft Creek year-round for use on private property. The point of diversion, water storage equipment, and water distribution infrastructure are located within protected lands of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (District) which are dedicated open space. Storms in early 2023 damaged the diversion infrastructure and it remains in disrepair. The Respondent, who purchased her property in 2015, asserts that the District has interfered with her right to divert water.  Respondent has failed to produce any evidence supporting the right to access District lands and divert water from Aldercroft Creek.  

Aldercroft Creek originates on and flows through Bear Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve, protected watershed lands owned and managed by the District in perpetuity for public benefit. Diversions by Ms. Ingram-Cauchi impair the District¿s ability to divert water from Aldercroft Creek under the pre-1914 right S026901, and harm the environment by negatively impacting instream habitat within protected watersheds where the District leads the ongoing recovery of threatened and endangered species.  

The District diverts water from Aldercroft Creek under the pre-1914 right S026901 for use at a horse stable facility within Bear Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve. The horse stable was part of the historic Tevis estate (1906-1934), which later become the Jesuit Alma College (1934-1969). The water is diverted to the stables by a series of gravity-fed surface PVC pipes. The diverted water is collected in a 2,500 gallon settling tank before reaching the stables, and is metered and reported to the State Water Resources Control Board annually in a Statement of Water Diversion and Use. The District is not aware of any evidence that a pre-1914 appropriation was perfected and maintained for use on Respondent¿s property, which was not served by the historic Tevis property¿s documented water system. 

The District will withdraw the complaint if Respondent withdraws her water right claim and demand to access the District property and District water infrastructure. Respondent¿s property is served by a municipal water provider and is therefore not reliant on Aldercroft Creek water. In the event Respondent does not withdraw her claims, the District requests the State Water Board to investigate whether the Respondent has a water right and access right to divert water from Aldercroft Creek from a point of diversion on District lands.",Santa Clara,Aldercroft Creek,To be determined,37.1683,-122.0024,1,,yes,no,Jeffrey  Yeazell,6/6/2023 12:00:00 AM,David Liefert,N,Complainant,"5050 El Camino Real, Los Altos, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Alexa Ingram-Cauchi,N,Respondent,"19670 Old Santa Cruz Hwy, Los Gatos, California, 95033",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

Re:	Cross-Complaint re: COMP-57232 Regarding Access To and Right to Extract Water from Aldercroft Creek in Santa Clara County	

Dear Division of Water Rights:

On May 30, 2023, Mid-Peninsula Open Space District (District) filed a complaint (COMP-57232) with the State Water Resources Control Board (Board) Division of Water Rights asking the Board to ""investigate whether"" my client, Ms. Ingram-Cauchi ""has a water right."" 

Ms. Ingram-Cauchi, owns property at 19670 and 19800 Old Santa Cruz Hwy (APN 558-41-020 and APN 558-41-032), adjacent to and across Highway 17 from what is now Bear Creek Preserve (¿Preserve¿). Ms. Ingram-Cauchi uses and relies on water from the Aldercroft Creek Diversion (¿Diversion¿) on the Preserve for her horses, fruit orchards, vineyards and gardens. Her neighbors  (collectively, with Ms. Ingram-Cauchi, ¿Neighbors¿) also use and rely on this water for these and other beneficial uses.

The District recently removed the pipes conveying water from the Aldercroft Creek Diversion to my client¿s property, interfering with her and her neighbor¿s beneficial use of water. The District took this action without notice, despite the fact that the District knows that my client uses and relies on this water for beneficial uses. In response to this action, my client contacted the District to seek an amicable resolution of this matter. (See Exhibit A with attachments.) She also offered to provide the professional opinion from a historian which documents her pre-1914 water right. The District, instead, filed its complaint. 

Response to the District¿s Complaint

The District claims that it possesses a pre-1914 water right to extract water from the Diversion. It also asserts it has perfected this right by the act of filing a Statement of Use and Diversion (#S026901), and that my client, who diverts from the same source as the District, the Aldercroft Creek Diversion, has not perfected her right. The act of filing a Statement of Use and Diversion does not perfect or confirm the existence of a pre-1914 water right¿it merely records the right without verifying it. (See https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/board_info/faqs.html#toc178761093) Furthermore, upon being informed of the requirement to file the Statement with the Board yearly, Ms. Ingram-Cauchi and her Neighbors also filed a Statement of Use and Diversion, which are pending. (See Ex. B [filed Statement of Use and Diversion; Ex. C [emails acknowledging].) 

If the District possesses a valid pre-1914 water right, to the extent my client¿s property and that of her neighbors was once part of the same historic estate, the Tevis estate, that is the basis for the District's claimed right, it is illogical for the District to claim that my client does not possess the same right. 

Furthermore, my client has enlisted the assistance of an expert historian who has researched primary source documents, such as grant deeds, and hand-drawn maps, and her report concludes that these properties were part of the historic Tevis estate, contradicting the District¿s assertion that my client¿s property ¿was not served by the historic Tevis property¿s documented water system.¿ 

Ms. Ingram-Cauchi has continuously used water from the Aldercroft Creek Diversion since acquiring the property in 2015; her neighbors have relied on water from the Diversion since prior to the District¿s acquisition of the land for the Preserve in 1999.

DESCRIPTION: We live on Questhaven Road, near the intersection of Questhaven and Harmony Grove roads.  We have a creek that runs down the length of Questhaven Road.  Despite the rains, in the last 7-10 days the creek has been dry.  Walking upstream we discovered a property with a seemingly new dam/pond of considerable size.  It appears to be filling from the creek water.  Closer neighbors indicate it is a seasonal pond, but based upon its size, I'm concerned the new property owner may have further dammed up the creek, raising the height of the pond water.

My concerns for Thurston Lake is the lack of water flowing into the lake. Thurston Creek once ran 4-6 months of the year, supplying water to Thurston Lake. I have noticed that the creek flow has all but stopped. I researched the issue and found that where Thurston Creek passes through Ely Flat, owned by Beckstoffer Vineyards, two dams have been constructed to create two large holding ponds, preventing the creek from flowing to Thurston Lake. These dams are not visible from any main road, but you can see them from the Riviera housing development directly above, to the north of the flat.

My second concern is that Thurston Lake is also spring feed, with springs also visible along Thurston Creek during the dry months. These springs are no longer appearing. Approximately 100 feet south of Thurston Creek, just east of Soda Bay road, is a two year old well, pumping thousands of gallons of weather to fill a holding pond along highway 29 just a half mile west of Manning Flat. The water is piped about a mile from the well to the pond, which is used to water vineyards. This well appears to have reduced the underground spring water that used to feed Thurston Creek. The net result being the reduction of water in coming to the lake. This last September the lake was lower than it has ever been prior to the gorge draining Manning flat, created in 1920 or there abouts. My family has been on this property since 1897.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: I am a resident of Rancho Murieta, a Special District within unincorporated Sacramento County. Our community relies on local lakes for ALL water needs and relies on our Board run, private utilities administration; Rancho Murieta Community Services District (RMCSD).

The initial build out plans for the area were approved on incorrect information, as provided by RMCSD and found in Public Health Masterplan 3410005 dated 2010. See attached.  

The plan has been revised and amended several times and is still undergoing further changes all while developers are allowed to continue building homes. Please see pictures attached of our current drinking water Lake Calero.  

It only seems reasonable to ask that a moritorium be placed on new builds until correct water calculations and usage can be determined using current and future drought conditions with updated evaporation rates in sync with rising temperatures. 

The District is allowing (with County approval based on inaccurate details) extensive development within the community; adding hundreds of new homes onto an already fragile water supply and our water is running dangerously low. (See attached pictures taken Sep. 30, 2022) 

Developers are being allowed to use community water (instead of bringing in their own tanks) for dust control and other needs to further development. As development is using hundreds of thousands of gallons daily - this is a threat to the water supply of the community and needs to be stopped.

Rancho Murieta borders a nature preserve and the Cosumnes River runs through it to BLM waters in Lodi (Mokelumne River). Allowing construction along the Cosumnes is impinging on riverbank ecosystems, endangering wildlife within Rancho Murieta and a possible threat to BLM pollution.

Furthermore, on Sept. 28th & 29th, a developer's (Reynen and Bardis LLC) contractor was caught stealing water from an outlet that was not to be used. It was later known that this had been going on for several days with a tank being filled 6-7x daily. It is unknown how many thousands of gallons daily were taken from this outlet alone. There are other outlets throughout the community so it is unknown if this is still happening; only at a different outlet and/or if fire hydrant water is now jeapardized.

Had it not been for a resident, this theft would probably still be ongoing. Pictures attached of thefts in progress. 

As there is more than one construction site (different developers) it is a concern that water is being misused for development purposes and even more reason for a moratorium until proper protections can be put in place to stop possible thefts and new water calculations be determined.

DESCRIPTION: Erik Ekdahl, Deputy Director Division of Water Rights State Water Resources Control Board 1001 I Street Sacramento, CA 95812-2815 Complaint about Unlicensed Pond Wasting Water in Deer Creek Irrigation District March 17, 2020 Dear Mr. Ekdahl, An unlicensed pond on Tehama County Assessor Parcel Number 079-130-014 is being maintained on property operated as a cattle ranch by Jeff Rabo. This property is in Deer Creek Irrigation District, where the water rights are adjudicated under Tehama County Superior Court Decree No. 4089 (decree), in 1923. There are no storage rights for this property. This pond provides no beneficial use under the decree or for any use whatsoever. It reduces the legal agricultural water supply along Deer Creek, as well as the water available for instream, endangered species of salmon. The storage volume is probably over 10 acre-feet. In addition, this pond sometimes has uncontrolled spills of water containing manure from a cattle ranching operation. This discharge of waste enters a District canal, and then drains either to a canal in Stanford Vina Ranch Irrigation Company, or into Deer Creek and then the Sacramento River. This discharge of wasted is a potential threat to human health, property, and endangered species of salmon in Deer Creek and the Sacramento River. Summary: Remedy for Water Pollution and Discharge Onto Other Properties ? Storage of water with no water right and with no beneficial use must stop on APN 079-130-014. ? Steps must be taken to ensure that there is no accidental or wintertime storage of water. ? There must be no accidental or purposeful discharges of waste. ? The owner and Mr. Rabo must certify to the Water Board and to Deer Creek Irrigation District that water cannot and will not be stored. Jeff Rabo owns cattle on this property and maintains a cattle ranching operation. He fills this pond and keeps it full from water diverted for Deer Creek Irrigation District. However, this water has no beneficial use under the decree, or for any other use. The storage of water here must cease. This pond has no water right and cannot legally store water. This is in violation of Tehama County Superior Court Decree No. 4089 in 1923, as well as state law and Senate Bill 88. This water is used illegally, reducing the water supply available for irrigation, as well as reducing the water supply available for instream, endangered species of salmon in Deer Creek and the Sacramento River. There are sometimes uncontrolled spills of water containing manure from this cattle ranching operation. This discharge of waste enters a Deer Creek Irrigation District canal, and then drains either south to a canal in Stanford Vina Ranch Irrigation Company, or into Deer Creek and then the Sacramento River. This discharge of wasted is a potential threat to human health, property, and endangered species of salmon in Deer Creek and the Sacramento River. Jeff Rabo must ensure there can be no storage of water. This can be done in several ways, including removal of the dam, cutting a notch in the dam, installing a pipe drain that is locked open, or installing a permanent pumping station that automatically pumps the storage out.",Tehama,To be determined,,39.9492,-122.0343,2,,yes,no,Christine Chen,5/17/2023 12:00:00 AM,,Y,Complainant,", , , ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Jeff Rabo,N,Respondent,"26840 Vina Road, Vina, California, 96092",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,11898,Complaint,3/20/2020,,Christine Chen,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,"Alleged unauthorized reservoir.

02/08/22 - Reviewed complaint data. 

02/10/22 - Contacted complainant - see Contact Report for details. According to the complainant, the respondents are diverting water from an unnamed stream that flows through their property to fill two game ponds for hunting on their property, Indian Rock Ranch (IRR). The unnamed stream is a tributary to Poso Creek. GIS and LandVision data confirm there is a spring-fed stream that flows through IRR (APN 052-050-35-00-6) and continues to Poso Creek. Unable to find any record of water rights for this APN.

03/04/22 - Contacted local RWCB employee Russ Walls. Russ has no record of other complaints against IRR. If we need to visit the site he will assist with coordination.

04/04/22 - Received call from Ron Gayer 3/31. Called back 4/04. Ron explained DIedre Lavers (other Respondent) thought they didn't need to file if the ponds were under 10 ac-ft. Said the ponds are only filled when the unnamed stream is flowing. I explained he might have a pre-1914 right, at least riparian rights. Since they are using the water he should file an Initial Statement of Diversion since the Board has nothing on file for their parcel. He agreed to file and would confer with their attorney to confirm their rights. I said I would send a follow-up email to him with instructions and further information, and once proof of their filing of a Statement is received the Complaint can be dismissed since they would be in compliance.

11/10 - Created maps using APNs and forwarded to Kristine Grandin for review while discussing over the phone. She said the Troxels work for the Morgans, who own the property where the flow was diverted away. Kristine has lived on her property for 6 years and the Morgans and Troxels have always been there, but 2-3 years ago the Morgans split their parcel for their daughter who is living where the Troxels changed the diversion. The Morgans have ponds on their property that were used for horses but Kristine hasn't seen horses on their property for a while. Kristine and her neighbor the Gages have livestock ponds that were sourced from the flow that came from the Morgans. The Gages do not want to be involved but have lost their water too. The Troxels are using the diverted flow for irrigation. Backfilling work started December 2020, continued March 2021, and completed November 2021.  

None of the parties have a water right. I told Kristine we will need to investigate the source of the Morgans' water. If the source isn't a water body under SWRCB jurisdiction she would need to take it up with the Morgans. I suggested she and the Gages looking into obtaining a water right since they're riparian to Doty Creek.

The fire protection pond was originally included in the water right filed in 1950 (ID# A013864). The unlined fire protection pond was constructed during the 1940's and lies on top of a coarse gravel substrate. All-Coast Forest Products is aware that this pond leaks water significantly. All-Coast Forest Products ceased all water diversions during the Russian River Curtailment Order except for those used to fill the two ponds on their property. They filed a non-consumptive use exception to the curtailment order. They claim that the water is used for the enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat found in the two ponds. They also claim that all of the water diverted to their ponds returns to the Russian River through the vadose zone due to the rapid rate of infiltration caused by the coarse substrate. They included a report with pictures of wildlife in the two ponds when they submitted the non-consumptive use exception form. A copy of this report is attached to this investigation. The water can be seen leaking out of the pond and onto Lake Street in Cloverdale from satellite images.

Ezra Post filed a complaint regarding an allegation that his neighbor's (Alvin Robinson) cannabis cultivation is affecting his drinking water. Based on his allegation, it appears that Ezra Post has an unpermitted on-stream reservoir and has identified a domestic diversion. Ezra Post has neither a Statement or water right on file for the domestic diversion and reservoir on file. It would appear Ezra Post will need to consider filing for a SDUR (Small Domestic Use Registration). KG routed over SDUR to Ezra Post, which he filled out and submitted. SDUR is received/approved.

1) Water Scarcity.
This site is in water scarce zone 4. The applicant has rights to use surface water to fill a 3.2 acre pond at the top of the mountain from Nov 15-Mar 31 (State Water Resources Control Board License # 12581), and has rights to use 3 acre-feet per year from the pond. The applicant stated he used 1.5 acre feet/yr.   However, neighbors have observed water trucks (including filled at a city hydrant just off Los Alamos Rd) headed to the top of Los Alamos, and continuing up the short private road that accesses this site.  With the past 2 years of drought and higher temperatures, the pond may not have had sufficient water.  Yet when the county was alerted to the water trucking (which violates its cannabis ordinance), it refused to investigate, and even refused to ask the applicant if he had used trucked water. The applicant made no public denial to using trucked water, and stated he was not even aware how the pond was filled, that water ¿just appeared¿ in it.  That statement is inconsistent with state requirements of only allowing surface water diversion from Nov 15- Mar 31.  
In addition, the county will allow the applicant to use a new well to irrigate his cannabis crop (up to 0.5 acre feet/yr, including future residential use- the prior residence burned), but is not requiring any water use analysis (hydrogeological report, etc), despite the county¿s cannabis ordinance requiring such for all well water used for cannabis irrigation in water zones 3 and 4.  In prior communications to Sonoma County, California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration have requested water analyses across all water sources, zones and uses, stating that surface and ground water are interconnected.

No water rights acquired or statements filed as of 8/3/2022. 

Ward Hanes responded to NOV. He states that the plants grown are for personal use. He thought that the State of California allowed 6 plants to be grown per person. There are some sites on the property where 12-18 plants are grown together by 2-3 people. I advised him that it is most likely limited to 6 plants per parcel. I let him know I would research this issue and get back to him. Ward Hanes wants to come into compliance with the Water Board and wants to use his riparian rights for cannabis cultivation. He does not want to create a commercial cannabis cultivation site.

I responded to Ward Hanes on 5/23/22 advising him that the personal use exemption only applies for no more than six plants per parcel. Ward Hanes indicated that he would follow the cannabis cultivation policy regarding the personal use exemption. He also plans on keeping the two onstream reservoirs on his property and will file water rights for those two ponds. I also advised him that he may need to contact the regional board for 401 certification and CDFW for an LSA agreement if he plans to construct more reservoirs in the future. I'll be checking back in with him in a few weeks to assess his progress with obtaining rights.

COMPLAINT DESCRIPTION:
We are writing today because, per our local authorities (Mendocino County), this complaint is out of their jurisdiction
and falls within that of the State Water Resources Board. Our co-owners, Gudrun Allenstein/Tom Force are diverting
water from two springs on our shared property to an unpermitted cannabis operation located on APN 151-270-03-00.
They are doing so without our permission. After several attempts requesting them to cease, they refuse. We are
co-owners on a parcel of land in Mendocino County with Tom Force and Gudrun Allenstein, APN 151-270-07-00.
The Force/Allenstein's also own a neighboring parcel, APN 151-270-03-00 on which Ms. Allenstein has an
unpermitted cannabis operation. She diverts 100% of the water from two springs on our shared property, APN
151-270-07-00, to support her unpermitted illegal cannabis operation on APN 151-270-03-00. To support our claim
that the operation is illegal: She has no permits from the county or state to grow cannabis. She also is growing within
50' of a class 2 stream and has created an unpermitted creek crossing on York Creek (Class 1 stream) that she
drives across to support her cannabis operation. The road to the creek crossing goes through a Native American
cultural site which has been bulldozed into York Creek. The two homes, septic and water supply that she occupies
on parcel APN 151-270-03-00 are not permitted with Mendocino County. We are asking the State Water Resources
Board to stop Allenstein/Force from diverting water from parcel APN 151-270-07-00 to APN 151-270-03-00. We are
also asking for the creek crossing to be decommissioned and restored to it's original condition. To contact Gudrun

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: The Sweetwater Water Authority (SWA) gained control of the Loveland Fishing Area in a land swap with the Forest Service in 1996.  In 2020, SWA hired an external firm to do an efficiency study the results of which the firm sited monetary savings by drawing down from the Loveland Reservoir to historically low levels.  The firm warned SWA that this would have an adverse affect to the fishing easement and may require a CEQA evaluation.  No such evaluation was performed to my knowledge.  As a result of recent rains in the San Diego area, significant damage was done to the shoreline of the area and a tax payer floating dock was destroyed.  The damage is so significant that the SWA have closed the area to the public and have stated publicly that the area will be closed indefinitely.

WATERSHED: Huer Huero Creek Watershed
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: There is a reservoir built directly on the Huer Huero Creek.  This prevents the middle branch Huer Huero from naturally flowing until the reservoir is filled.  This usually does not happen until the area reaches more than 15-20"" of rain.  This leaves downstream environment damaged and parched for water.  It also leaves the groundwater along the creek severely impacted.  Wells have been dry for years when the natural run off from the creek would otherwise keep the ground water levels intact.  It is also concerning that no one is in charge of up keep or maintenance which leaves a major safety concern to all properties beneath the reservoir.  If it were full and somehow failed, a dangerous amount of water could be released quickly leaving many homes and properties vulnerable to a flash flood scenario.  If the owner has rights or this reservoir serves some sort of other purpose then I withdraw the complaint, however I do not see any purpose of this reservoir so I am confused why it exists while many other property owners are left with dry wells throughout the years and vegetation and species along the creek struggle for water.

cultivate 80 acres of cannabis directly across the street from a major water user in our valley, Brassfield Estates
Winery. SourzHVR has been unsuccessful drilling wells on their property APN 006-004-070 to irrigate their plants so
they have made an arrangement with Brassfields to pipe water from a holding pond on Brassfields property that
draws water from the aquifer we all share. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhazVwh3TfE) This arrangement is
outside of the plan presented to the county for this project yet the county is looking the other way. We have
approximately 16 residents in the valley and no less than 5 of our wells have run dry. We question the legality of this
arrangement and have grave concerns our aquifer cannot support two major water users while still providing
life-giving water to the residents. We would like someone to look into Brassfields' reporting of water use under their
water rights given they are now supporting an additional major project that is not their own. What will happen to our

Maria Kann complained of a large-scale commercial cannabis cultivation site located at APN 006-004-070. SourzHRV Inc. and Aviona LLC are the operating parties for the grow site. There are 4 DCC licenses that are associated with this property. Supposedly, water from the large reservoir at Brassfield Estates Winery is being conveyed to the grow site on the neighboring APN. There has been alot of backlash from the community in opposition of the grow site due to concerns about water availability. Residents are concerned that the High Valley Aquifer cannot withstand the depletion of water from two major water users, the winery and the grow site.

WATERSHED: Santa Ana River Watershed
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: Our stream

I have concerns how my neighbors activities is affecting the stream in several ways.
We live within the Cleveland National Forest, on the Morrell Potrero. The water that flows from my region is crucial in supporting of Region 8 -- Santa Ana Regional Water District.

I have concerns from water rights to water quality.
We also have many sensitive and endangered species in our area.

His address will verify the location. 

California Water Boards, Fully Appropriated Stream Systems (FASS) lists the stream as Santa Ana River Watershed, Tributary to the Pacific Ocean. 
Season: 1/1 to 12/31
Critical Reach: from the mouth of the Santa Ana River at the Pacific Ocean upstream including all tributaries where hydraulic continuity exists. 


I looked up on the states mapping to verify a permit could be obtained to pump water from streams in our area and if legal had a permit been obtained for that location to see if a permit could be obtained to pump water from a stream my area at any time. 
* This area it is not possible to obtain a permit at any time during the year to pump water from a stream.
* No history of a permit found to pump water from a stream for that address.

The pictures I have submitted show.

* Stream flow has been modified with a poured concrete dam.
* Poured concrete dam was poured into an actively flowing stream, potentially raising the PH of the stream. Increased PH in a stream has the potential to harm aquatic life.
* Livestock in and around the stream water and field. Pigs wallow in the stream and  stream water pumped from the stream into field. The livestock exposes the stream water to animal feces. The pumped stream water eventually returns to the stream but water has been exposed to animal feces during surface flow. The returning stream water is milky, muddy in color, this can not be good for the sensitive aquatic ecosystem. In addition it takes several days for the downstream water levels to recover from his pumping activity, starving anything in the stream of water during that time.
* There is an increase risk of mosquitoes any time there is standing water. The neighbors stream pump project into the livestock field has caused standing water in hoof depressions. The standing water attracts mosquitoes, increasing the transmission risk of West Nile Virus.
* Please, your help is needed in so many ways¿.

Investigation Summary:
Mike Matlock began contacting the Division in 2021 about his concern regarding the lack of water in Mill Creek near Laytonville, CA. On July 13, 2021, Matlock submitted his original CalEPA complaint (COMP-51304). Matlock reported a sudden drop in water flow in Mill Creek (aka Little Case Creek) that runs near his property (Mendocino APN 014-500-05-00). In response, the Division determined that Phillip Gravier¿s unpermitted onstream pond on APN 014-500-37-00 was responsible for the lack of water in Mill Creek. On November 30, 2021, Division staff Alex Marten and Sahil Pathak conducted a field inspection of Gravier¿s onstream on Tuttle Creek and alleged violations of WC section 5101 and 1052. The Report of Investigation (ROI) was received by Gravier on February 11, 2022. Division staff did not follow up with Gravier to ensure that a water right was filed for the unpermitted onstream reservoir due to emergency drought projects that took precedent over enforcement actions.  

On September 16, 2022, Mike Matlock submitted another CalEPA complaint (COMP-55096) reporting that another sudden halt in water flow occurred in Mill Creek near this property in Laytonville, CA. Matlock believes that someone or a group of people upstream from his POD are diverting water without a permit. This complaint was assigned to Mollie Preijers on December 15, 2022. I spoke with Matlock on January 11, 2023 about his complaint and got a better understanding of the situation. I conducted an aerial imagery review using historical imagery and lidar to view the onstream reservoir on Gravier¿s property. This appeared to be the greatest use of water in the area and seemed to be directly related to the lack of water flow to the Matlock property that is downstream. On April 3, 2023, I emailed Phillip Gravier requesting that he contact the Division to discuss his compliance with the Water Code, I also attached the 2022 ROI and NOV to the email. I received a response from Aaron Baker, Gravier¿s attorney, who provided me with a Pond Study and a Soil Study that was conducted on the Gravier property. Baker also sent a copy of the LSUR that was submitted to the Division. With all the work that Gravier has done to come into compliance, I will be closing this complaint once the status of L033378 has been changed from ¿pending¿ to ¿certified.¿ CID6339 will not be closed until the other associated INV ID¿s have been resolved and closed.

Update 06/09/2023: The Division received a complaint from CDFW regarding a potential illegal diversion in Marshall Creek in Santa Cruz County at APN 078-131-02.

I acquired contact information for the property owners via WestLaw and drafted a Complaint Request for Information Letter that was mailed physically via certified mail and email on May 24, 2023. On June 1, 2023, I received confirmation that the letter was received from the Respondent. On June 5, 2023, I spoke with the Respondent, Megan Renfrew on the phone and discussed that they had submitted a Statement of Diversion and Use form on August 3, 2022. Megan Renfrew also confirmed that she submitted a Change of Ownership form for an inactive Statement (S009468) that had been cancelled by the Division due to inactivation.  I had missed their Statement in eWRIMS in my initial investigation because no Point of Division was included on the eWRIMS GIS map.

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: I live at 44432 E. Carmel Valley Road, Greenfield, 93927 (Arroyo Seco area). My neighbor, Dio Roberts, at 44258 Carmel Valley Road and I live on properties with Paloma Creek running through them year round. At the beginning of July the flow of water coming from upstream (Mr. Roberts property) suddenly stopped altogether. It would normally be flowing. The creek is spring fed and there is always surface water running through our two properties only. In fifty years of my family's stewardship of the property where I live I've never seen this happen.

DESCRIPTION: Complaint was generated on the behalf of the complainant by Deler Ghazi, requested via email. There are pictures in the links and more in the files tab.

Good morning California Environmental and Dam Safety Caretakers.

I have your CalEPA complaint form open.
To my understanding, photos and links can not be used.
The form requests providing as much detail as possible and only my documents, photos and links would make that possible.
A picture tells a thousand words. People have already written the supporting background.
Is there and alternate format to submit the complaint with photos, images, and links?
I am including some examples of the hundreds of pieces of evidence that I have to share.

I could do better if DSOD and Waterboards would be more communicative.

Does CalEPA investigate unnecessary, but deliberate terrible environmental damage and public benefit harm following green taxpayer funding of large ""green"" projects?
Even if it would not have been an offense or as serious of an offense without the offender having taken the advantages California gave them towards being better environmental stewards?
If CalEPA does not demand this kind of decency and accountability , who does?

The offending water district was given $31.5 million for a desalination plant , most of it from California, but some from the Bureau of Reclamation. With the water security the desalination plant gave the district the board of directors destroyed a 75 year minimum pool and built riparian habitat for 11 weeks of water. They killed all the fish and destroyed public recreation and refuse to reopen which for some simple recreation types , looks like retaliation. I can easily prove that the water district attacked environmental and public resources starting immediately after the green project came online. This was done by radically changing decades old standard operating procedure despite abysmal cost benefit scenarios.

It also appears that the water district has violated their capture limit, or put themselves in a situation that demonstrates that they don't care if they do. Alternatively , to escape a violation with a transfer , the directors could put the downstream dam in danger. As it stands it's a violation. This initial violation also risked over topping, or causing emergency releases at a FEMA high hazard dam that has been under DSOD scrutiny and pressure to repair for decades. I have already proved to DSOD that the directors of the water district are hostile to fixing the dam and spent the money DSOD ordered them to get in 2016 on other things.

WR DESC: Riparian Water Right to spring
WATERSHED: South Fork Salmon River
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: The United States Forest Service (USFS) received an application for a special use permit in 2015 from Howard Bentley, a private property owner, for the diversion and withdrawal of water from an unnamed spring on National Forest System (NFS) lands. A site visit confirmed the spring is located on NFS land. The overflow from the spring remains on NFS land until flowing across private property owned by Robin George. Once exiting Mr. George?s property, it flows back onto NFS land and into the South Fork Salmon River. The water doesn?t flow directly across Mr. Bentley?s private property. The USFS only assumes a riparian water right if the water flows directly and naturally across a parcel of private property. The USFS informed Mr. Bentley he would need to obtain an appropriated water right from the state. Mr. Bentley contacted the Division of Water Rights and was informed by Matthew McCarthy that under Hutchins (1956), he may be able to exercise his claim to a riparian right on the South Fork Salmon River by diverting water from a tributary flowing into the South Fork Salmon River. In this case, the South Fork Salmon River flows crosses Mr. Bentley?s property within approximately 20 to 30 feet of the unnamed water source entering it. It should be noted that maps depicting private property locations in this area are incorrect. The USFS field verified actual property locations through locating the relevant survey markers on the ground.

There are at least four families now living on property. There is no water conservation effort in place even though Sonoma County is requiring 25% cut back on water drawn from Russian River of which this is a tributary.

About a week ago our neighbor drove his excavator up along our properties and dug a large stock pond in the creek that runs down his property.

The complainant states that the creek on their land is filled by storm water runoff (sheet flow) and by a natural spring on their property. 

05/05/2022 started office investigation. 

The complainant's property is located in a residential housing area close to Rodeo Creek but is separated from the creek by a road and a block of houses. There are no water rights in the area. Determined that the spring-filled creek in question needs more verification to determine where the creek ends; if it flows off the property or not. This creek does not have a riparian water right associated with it, but it may qualify as an exemption to the water code 5101 if the creek does not flow off the property and the diversion from the spring flow does not exceed 25 acre-feet/year.

The property with the creek has a lot area of 29,960 SF (0.69 ACRES); predict the spring flow does not exceed 25 acre-feet/year.

5/07/2022 started Office Investigation

The location of the Lat./Long given in the complaint is on a property owned by the Gund Real Estate LLC; property parcel APN: 125-060-03. 

Near the location given, there is what appears to be a small reservoir formed at the base of multiple ephemeral streams. A GIS streams layer confirms the existence of adjacent ephemeral streams. The reservoir is very geometrical, indicating a man-made reservoir. After viewing imagery from many years back on google earth, it appears that the reservoir has been present for a very long time. 

This property was purchased by the Gund Real Estate LLC in Nov 2021. 

There is not a water right associated with the property and any diversion of water into storage requires a water right. Next step: contact the Gund Real Estate LLC to require a water right for the reservoir and issue a potential notice of violation. 

6/06/2022
Notice of potential NOV letters with a map attachment were sent to George Gund and Gund Real Estate LLC addresses; found on the Better Business Bureau website. The potential violation letters explained that a reservoir has been found on the land parcel APN 125-060-030 and that they have been identified as the owners of the land parcel. They were asked to respond with answers to how the water is being used, if there are any water rights attached to it, how much water the reservoir holds and when the reservoir was constructed.

According to the LandVission website, the Gund Real Estate LLC purchased the land on Nov 16, 2021, but google earth shows the reservoir existing over 50 years before the purchase. Therefore, they may not know when the reservoir was constructed.

Complaint closed on 3/7/2023. Respondent (Blue Marble Acres Farm who has partnered with UC Davis Extension in Marin County) has confirmed that the pond is not storing surface water, but rather liquid manure from a nearby dairy farm and that the pond is isolated from the ephemeral streams nearby.

In addition, Ms. Larios is claiming that this illegal water diversion is directly affecting the water availability of a recreation area called Laird Park. She mentions that she has previously reached out to the local fish and game authorities and they have not been helpful.

5/11/2022 started Office Investigation

The lat./long location given in the compliant was not adjacent to a land parcel owned by Venn farms. Instead I searched for the Venn Farms property and found that it is a neighboring property, downstream of the lat./long. location given. 

The Venn Farms property is found along the stream but does not have any water right PODs along the property. Upon further investigation of neighboring properties adjacent to the Venn Farm property, there is a neighboring land-locked property owned by a Timothy Venn and Melodie Venn. 

After searching for where the Laird Park mentioned in the complaint was located, I found it to the south west of the Venn Farm property. Laird Park does not appear to be downstream of Venn Farm in any direct way from the Tuolumne River. Using GIS stream maps I found a canal stream that connects Venn Farm and Laird Park. Perhaps this water connection is the reference that the complainant is accusing Venn Farms affecting the Laird Park's water supply. 

The water rights PODs nearest the Venn Farm property are either Appropriative or pre-1914 water rights. 

Using GIS stream maps of California, it would appear that the Tuolumne River that is adjacent to Venn Farms is an ""artificial stream"" that has been moved from its natural flow. However it was at this location before 1914 when neighboring properties received their riparian water rights.

Found that Venn Farm LP is listed as an Agricultural Production industry. However, there does not appear to be a water right associated with the land parcel. 

6/8/2022 

I contacted Tim Venn at (209) 537-9996. He shared that Venn Farms gets its water from a Turlock Irrigation District (TID). 
I contacted TID to verify that Venn Farms APN 017-049-017 uses their services and it was confirmed.

DESCRIPTION: My name is Greg Vierra. I live at 20872 River Road in Stevinson, California. I have lived for over fifty years using water from the Merced River for my Farm. The past years it has been challenging with the river so low due to drought. Due to extremely low river flows, there is a higher chance of toxic algae being created. The river flow has been reduced more and more to near no flow. The river flow is at the lowest flow I have ever seen in my life, this week!!!! The river sensors/monitors which measure flows from Yosemite to Stevinson can be viewed at www.cdec.water.ca.gov. Per website, it shows more water flowing to the Snelling area and barely no river flow in Stevinson. Today, July 28, 2022, several pictures were taken of Merced River flows adjacent to our farm. This needs to be reviewed. I would hope that an agency can investigate if water is going to people with land that riparian rights and or over 100 year water rights. If after investigating, if all who are entitled to river water are receiving water from Merced River, there is great need to increase river flow.

WATERSHED: Goose Lake
EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: On July 11th, 2022, I have discovered the source of many complaints from water users on the California Ditch, an irrigation conduit off Pine Creek located in New Pine Creek, CA. As Modoc County Watermaster, I installed a lockable and adjustable gate for security purposes to mitigate tampering. This gate was destroyed by an unknown individual and the Modoc County Sherriff and Deputy arrived on the scene to witness the vandalism. 

Off the California Ditch, on Pinecreek Canyon Road heading into the canyon, on the west side of the first house on the right is an illegal diversion belonging to David Lawson and Richard Lawson. This diversion is a large diameter pipeline with a gate valve. Upon further research that this pipeline had not been filed with the California State Water Resources Control Board, DWR, the Modoc Superior Court, or with the Modoc County Watermaster Department, I counted the pipeline diversion illegal, as it directly violates Decree No. 2821 adjudicated and decreed by the Modoc County Superior Court. Upon this revelation, I condemned the pipeline, closing it and applying a hefty lock and chain on the headgate. 
Decree No. 2821 clearly states DWR Tracts 12-1, 2, and 3 belonging to F. M. Green, J. D. Heryford, and A. C. Robnett, respectively, as decreed landowners are to receive waters for irrigation from the main channel. These are the lands belonging to the Lawsons. The Lawsons have and are taking the waters designated to these three separate lands all into the pipeline and applying the waters for three separate lands excessively onto one. Waters have been adjudicated at a rate of 0.02 cfs per acre. This constitutes not only a change in place of diversion but also a change in place of use. 

There are additional water users downstream that have been caused injury from the massive diversion of water through the pipeline both on the California Ditch as well as the main channel. 

Allegedly, attorneys became involved. David Lawson and Richard Lawson along with other cohorts have rallied against their Decree No. 2821 and Watermaster claiming, ¿He is doing it for the fish.¿ Others have said, ¿He just likes to watch the waters go by his house.¿ This has led to the perception of conflict of interest. However, I am not a water user, nor are any immediate relatives water users. I merely live in New Pine Creek. 

Then, in a turn of events, and behind my back, Chester Robertson, the County Administrative Officer, a water user, and Department Head of the Watermaster Department who has a clear conflict of interest appointed David Lawson on August 20th, 2022 as ¿ditchmaster¿ until a new Watermaster has been found to apply the allocation of the decree. This was proven by text message on David Lawson¿s cell phone as I confronted him on Saturday August 20th, 2022. I recorded video of the entire dialog.

David Lawson first claims that he is the ¿new Watermaster¿, then shows me the text log from Chester Robertson. I inform David that Chester is breaking the law as a water user may not play any authority role relating to the Water Department. David then calls the Modoc County Sherriff and proceeds to threaten me to ask, ¿Can you send someone over before someone gets hurt?¿ Then he quickly calls Chester Robertson. I ask Chester, ¿What is happening?¿. He replies, ¿I am having Fish and Wildlife called on us now, let¿s just get this flowing the way it was historically until I can get this figured out.¿ I respond, ¿The way it has historically flown is not through this pipeline.¿ Chester says, ¿I¿m trying to get water to flow down the California Ditch.¿ I respond, ¿Yes, the water was flowing down the California Ditch as it always has been, as it was adjudicated.

DESCRIPTION: Our neighbor Andrew Pillet (11208 Loch Haven Drive, Santa Rosa, CA 95404) has blocked and diverted a creek on his property that fed onto our property preventing any water from reaching our property. As a result our well (11200 Loch Haven Drive) has gone dry. Mr Pillet was in violation previously with the California Water Board (WDID No. 1B20198WNSO) for the blocking the creek and continues to refuse to remedy the situation.  The creek is still blocked.  Additionally, he has exasperated the situation by digging a ditch before the blockage that diverts the water from said creek back onto his property.  Needless to say we are out of water and have resorted to weekly water deliveries at great financial expense to us.  With summer starting the situation is getting dire.",Sonoma,To be determined,,38.5587,-122.7054,2,,yes,no,John Murphy,6/29/2023 12:00:00 AM,Meher Gourjian,N,Complainant,"305 Hillside Ave, Piedmont, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Pillet,N,Respondent,"11208 Loch Haven Dr, Santa Rosa, California, ",,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: On Wednesday May 24 I was working at our vineyard in Oakville when I heard a generator like noise coming from Doak Creek (now To Kalon Creek) on the south boundary. Investigating, I discovered a gas powered pump diverting water from the creek via a  garden hose, then into a larger pipe connected to one of several large water tanks on the south bank of the creek. I encountered a worker who when questioned about the set up, professed no knowledge. I contacted my brother who is our active ranch manager about this incident. The next morning he said there was no water diversion going on. In the afternoon of May 26 i saw that the operation had indeed been moved and no water was now being diverted. I spoke to Daniel Zador planner at Environmental Services Napa who when informed about several large water tanks without setback from the creek, said 35 feet is the normal setback from a blue-line creek unless there is an exemption. These tanks sit directly on the south bank of Doak Creek/ToKalon Creek.",Napa,To be determined,,,,5,,yes,no,Roberto Cervantes,6/8/2023 12:00:00 AM,Ken Stanton,N,Complainant,"395 Clark Way

EJ COMPLAINT: 
DESCRIPTION: I have property in Laytonville that was subdivided in 1967 when wetlands and seasonal creeks were reflected on the parcel maps. There is an easement, with no existing road, drawn in 1967, between my property and my south neighbors property. 30 feet on each side, thru a wetland and across a seasonal creek. The easement comes from country road 307 to a property east of us. The property owner is not landlocked. He bought an easement from Huntsman way to his grow and has been during it for a couple years. I have concern the road will impact my permitted pond since it will go thu the seasonal creek that feeds it then goes into the 10 mile watershed to the Eel. Last year, 2018, the property owner drilled a 200 foot well and ran it dry. At that time I ran out of water. I have been here since 1980 supplying two households with water. The neighbors to the south were impacted also. The property owner has a history of trespass trying to access water. 10 years ago he dug a hole in the seasonal creek with an excavator put a cement ring in the creek. The neighbor at the time wouldn't let him use it. He then dug a hole in the seasonal creek on my property. It caused the water not to run in the creek but spill over and flood to my house. I called him and asked him to fix it said he would didn't. My boyfriend and I hand dug the creek. Last she 2018 when his new well on the hill ran dry he brought an excavator down the hill to the seasonal creek at dusk. I saw it there so my neighbor to the south and I went to find out why he was on our properties with equipment. He told us he was doing a ""test"" for water since he concluded ""Water is at the bottom of the hill."" We told him he can't dig in the seasonal creek and showed him the property markers we knew . His property is mostly hilly where he has his commercial cannabis grow. He decided to execute this easement in order to drill a well on the lower part of his property between Wilson creek and the seasonal creek. A well drilling rig cannot access that area from the road he uses. He is planning to use this wetland easement to dig a well in the valley. Last season after he ran his well out he was buying 5000 gallons of water per day for his grow. There are no residences on his property. If he drills a deep well in this area he will take water from seven households for his business. We are landowners who live on our properties. We have children, grandchildren and elders. We cannot lose our water to a commercial interest.",Mendocino,To be determined,,39.6882,-123.4828,2,1,yes,no,Christopher  Borsh,6/27/2019 12:00:00 AM,Joann Sims,N,Complainant,"P.O.

DESCRIPTION: The Shasta river remains below emergency drought regulatory levels. As of 11am, 8-5-22, the river is at 44.1cfs, having not been above the regulated flow level of 50cfs for several days.

Additional addendum, Order WR 2022-0162-DWR, which went back in water right priority had an approximately a 24-hr net benefit.

Excessive ground water extraction, unpermitted well drilling, and an overall disdain for the process is flying in the face of the non-existent enforcement of the regulations.

The SSWD will not add the DFW 1707 water on top of the 50cfs, nor will they pass that water to the mouth. We should be seeing 50cfs + 7-8cfs 1707 water. Meaning if the flow dips below 55cfs, then the regulations are being broken and enforcement must occur.

I come from a ranching family so I understand the argument that they are singled out. What about the Tribes? What about commercial fishing? What about the river and the fish? What about Public Trust Reousrces?

""I briefly mentioned that HPULs water operator has seen drastic increased water usage and we are suspecting its for illegal cannabis grows. HPULs water system is a public system that supplies water to the rancheria which is checkerboarded with non tribal land. HPUL had implemented water conservation measures during the drought and is still in place. HPUL has written into their utility ordinance ¿water abuse¿ will lead to shutoffs (https://www.hpultribe-nsn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/10-1-ULPD-Utility-Ordinance-Date-Unknown.pdf). 

HPUL administration has tried to reach out to County Code Enforcement in the past for illegal grows but have been told they do not have jurisdiction on tribal land. My supervisor and the executive council want to ensure water conservation and environmental health. They also do not like that they are basically providing a cheap water source for illegal grows. Any guidance or enforcement measures will be greatly appreciated!

HPUL Water Operator provided me the following APNs & address for water abuse and suspected water abuse:
APN	Address	Notes
003-059-030 	10715 Rancheria Rd, Upper Lake CA 95485	Has reached shutoff threshold for water abuse
